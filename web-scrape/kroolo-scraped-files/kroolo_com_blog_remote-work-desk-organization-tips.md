## Desk Management Tips For Remote Management 2024
### **(A) Desk organization ideas to organize paperwork**
Nothing is more disturbing than finding cabinets and drawers full of paper and files. Here’s a quick overview of how to avoid piles and keep them organized at your workstation-:
### 1. Invest in the filling system 
Purchase a filling system and label every file with specific project details and date of commencement. Categorize them based on priority, status, or project name for quick retrieval.

Keep a separate tray to organize your important documents, display decorative items, and incoming & outgoing bills, or hold cups with miscellaneous stationery items. Such desk management tips will make your desk look cleaner and tidier than before. 
### 3. Labeling everything 
Label everything – from drawers to folders and containers with color coding for quick identification. Also, you can even install wall-mounted pockets for storing documents that are used often. This will make your desk clutter-free and allow you to get documents within a stretch. 
### **(B) Small office organization ideas**
Whether you’re a freelancer or homeworker and want to organize your small office space, implement these little changes to leave a huge impact on your working space. 
### 4. Invest in multi-functional furniture and the right office chair 
Choose furniture that can be multi-purposed like a desk. See if it can be used as a cabinet and has built-in drawers and storage or that can even work as a printer stand. Importantly, you must invest in the right chair too. According to [ergonomics experts](https://www.spine-health.com/wellness/ergonomics/office-chair-choosing-right-ergonomic-office-chair), you should search for the right office chair that has- 
  * A backrest that’s 12 to 19 inches wide
  * Adjustable seat height and armrests
  * Lumbar support for your lower back


This helps you to work in a comforting position & reach different areas of the desk without straining much. 
### 5. Use a timer 
Even if you’ve most creatively set up your workstation, you still need a break from work to charge up your productivity, right? According to the [American Psychological Association](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-12793-001), taking “microbreaks” (for example, getting up from your desk to stretch or grabbing a cup of coffee) charge your body and bring productivity to work. That’s why you should invest in a handy timer to take short breaks. 
You can try the [_Pomodoro Technique_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)– a commonly practiced time management technique. Start with 25 minutes. Take a 5-minute break extra when the timer goes off. In that extra break, stretch your muscles, take a quick walk, and refill your bottle. This small activity brings you back to your desk with 2x more energy.
### 6. Use translucent containers 
Store office supplies in translucent containers or bins so you can easily see what’s inside. You can use bright fluorescent colors to label them for quick identification. 
### 7. Whiteboard or green board 
Fix a whiteboard or greenboard where you can write your daily tasks or monthly targets, reminders, and to-do lists. You can use pushpins to insert motivational quotes for your leaders as work inspiration. 
### 8. Use floor lamps instead of desk lamps 
Shift to floor lamps and illuminate your office space with different light intensities. It serves as a decorative element and ensures proper lighting without cluttering your work desk. Make sure the cord of the floor lamp is long enough to connect to a nearby power switch. 
According to [WeWork](https://www.wework.com/en-GB/ideas/workspace-solutions/best-office-lighting), floor lamps with warmer orange or yellow make you feel more relaxed, calm, and less stressed. While desk lamps with white and blue lights keep you active and help you concentrate better. 
P.S. If you've to attend a lot of video calls, it’s suggested to add a ring light to your office room. Such work desk organization ideas will help you interact better with your team. 
## **(C) Desk organization ideas to conceal clutter**
Conceal clutter and make your workplace look cleaner. If you can’t cut the office supplies but want a neater and well-organized-looking desk, consider these ideas to smartly hide any additional clutter -: 
### 9. Group similar categorial items together 
To avoid clutter, avoid managing multiple drawers for storing office supplies. From scissors to sticky notes and your washi tape, put everything into one drawer. You can put small size adjustable organizer into your drawer to categorize the stationary items.
### 10. Choose the smart workspace management software
Are you someone who writes everything in sticky notes and calls it important? However, this isn’t the right route to take. Pinning so many notes can make your desk look cluttered. Instead, choose the [smart workspace management software](https://kroolo.com/). Create and manage unlimited personalized workspaces in Kroolo. 
Whether it's personal or professional, you can seamlessly create goals, assign tasks, and share documents within each workspace. Treat your workspace as your team space and collaborate with your team without switching apps. 
### 11. Limit personal items from your desk 
Many times we clutter our desks with overwhelming pictures and knick-knack items. Limiting or removing such items from your desk can make it look organized. Although, it might be tempting to décor your workstation with creative items & motivational artworks. But that can quickly become a distraction. So, follow the principle of 'the lesser, the better' always!
### 12. Clean before you leave 
According to a [Princeton University study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21228167) clutter makes it challenging for people to focus on particular tasks. Imagine it’s Monday morning and you’ve grabbed a cup of coffee and entered your workspace to get started with your routine. And, today you've to create an important compliance document and send it to your project head. But, looking at this clutter, you are confused as to where to start cleaning. 
So, having a messy workstation often affects your productivity. Instead of kick-starting your day, it spoils your mood and makes you less active because you've to drain your energy in cleaning that stuff first. This is the [best way to organize desks for remote work management](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21228167).
Therefore, make it your habit. Clean your workplace before you go. 
Conclusion
