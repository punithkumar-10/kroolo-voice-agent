Ever wonder why some projects feel like they're stuck in a one-way street with no room for change? Traditional waterfall project management has its challenges‚Äîextended timelines and rigid progress. 
But get this, according to [Harvard Business Review](https://utilitiesone.com/collaboration-and-knowledge-management-ensuring-seamless-success-in-engineering), 75% of teams using [collaboration tools](https://kroolo.com/blog/9-online-tools-for-team-collaboration-to-try) saw better project success. Now, imagine [collaborative project management software](https://kroolo.com/features/projects) swooping in as the hero.ü¶∏
It brings flexibility and dynamism to a waterfall, making projects adaptable and progressing smoothly.üíπIt's like having the best of both worlds‚Äîstructured yet flexible. 
So, next time your project hits a roadblock, think about collaboration magic to keep it rolling seamlessly! üöÄ‚ú®
## **What is Waterfall Project Management?**
[Waterfall project management](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/what-is-waterfall-methodology/) is like tackling your to-do list one step at a time. It's a linear approach where each phase, like planning and testing, flows into the next, just like a waterfall. Once a phase is done, you move on to the next.‚è©
It's organized and structured but might not be as flexible when changes pop up. Think of it as following a clear path from start to finish. In short, it is characterized by a sequential flow of activities, with each stage buildingü™úupon the completion of the previous one. 
The typical stages of waterfall project management include:-
![Collaborative Project Management Software](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/03/12/kroolo_xIxGdI3.jpg)
**1. Requirements**
In this stage, the project team worksüßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßëclosely with stakeholders to gather and document all project requirements. This involves understanding the needs and expectations of the client or end-users.
**2. Design**
Based on the gathered requirements, the system design phase involves creating detailed specifications for the system. This may include architecture, hardware, software, data, and user interface design.
**3. Implementation**
In this stage, the actual development of the project takes place. The project team works on coding and programming based on the specifications outlined in the system design phase. It is the most labor-intensive phase of the waterfall model.
**4. Integration**
After the implementation phase, the individual components or modules are integrated into a complete system. This is followed by thorough testing to ensure that the system functions according to the specified requirements.üîéTesting includes mainly unit testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.
**5. Deployment**
Once the system has been thoroughly tested and approved, it is deployed to the production environment. This involves installing the system and making it available for end-users.
**6. Maintenance**
After deployment, the system enters the maintenance phase. This stage involves addressing any issues that arise, making updates or enhancements, and providing ongoing support to ensure the system continues to meet user needs.
## **How to Choose the Best Waterfall Project Management Tool?**
When choosing a waterfall [collaborative project management](https://kroolo.com/blog/teamwork-triumphs-taking-a-closer-look-at-the-benefits-of-workplace-collaboration) software, ask the following questions -:
  * **Tailored features -** Does it offer stage-specific support? (e.g., clear modules for requirements, design, and implementation)
  * **User-friendly interface -** Is the interface intuitive for all team members? (e.g., straightforward navigation and minimal training required)
  * **Customization options -** How much can we tailor it to our workflows? (e.g., adjusting task categories or project milestones)
  * **Cost-effectiveness -** Does the pricing suit our budget? (e.g., any free plan or affordable monthly pricing)
  * **Integration capabilities -** Does it smoothly integrate with our existing tools? (e.g., compatibility with communication or version control software)
  * **Scalability -** Can it grow with our project? (e.g., handling increased tasks or potentially replacing other tools in the future)


[![collaborative project management software](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/03/02/13.png)](https://app.kroolo.com/signup?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=CTA&utm_content=understanding-waterfall-management-with-collaborative-project-management-software)
## **How Waterfall Model Works with Collaborative Project Management Software**
Waterfall management is a traditional project management approach that follows a linear and sequential process, with each phase of the project completed before moving on to the next. 
On the other hand, collaborative [project management software](https://kroolo.com/blog/best-project-management-software) is designed to facilitate teamwork, communication, and coordination among team members. 
While these two concepts might seem somewhat conflicting, it is possible to use collaborative project management software in conjunction with a waterfall approach. Here's how:
### **1. Project planning**
In the waterfall model, detailed planning is done at the beginning of the project. Collaborative project management software can be used to create and share project plans, timelines, and milestones. 
Tools like Kroolo enhance [team collaboration](https://kroolo.com/blog/9-steps-for-effective-team-collaboration-in-2024) by enabling real-time collaboration on project requirements, designs, and plans. The AI-powered approach of solutions like Kroolo ensures effective collaboration, providing intelligent insights throughout the planning process.
### **2. Task allocation**
After establishing the project plan in the Waterfall model, tasks are allocated to team members. Each member gains visibility into their responsibilities, deadlines, and dependencies, fostering collaboration and transparency.
![Collaborative Project Management Software](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/04/24/1.jpg)
Kroolo's task panel plays a pivotal role in this process, efficiently organizing task updates in alignment with waterfall project management. It enables clear task assignments and seamless progress tracking, ensuring everyone stays informed and on top of their responsibilities at each stage.
### **3. Documentation**
Waterfall projects prioritize thorough documentation. You can invest in the right collaborative tool that streamlines [document creation](https://kroolo.com/blog/how-to-write-technical-documentation-like-an-expert-6-step-by-step-guide) and sharing, ensuring all team members stay updated. For instance, Kroolo's [document management features](https://kroolo.com/blog/how-to-write-technical-documentation-like-an-expert-6-step-by-step-guide), including version control, provide a clear project history, essential for the waterfall's sequential stages. 
Also, users can effortlessly create and format documents, embedding various elements, for versatile needs. Kroolo's intuitive editing options enhance the efficiency of document management in Waterfall projects.
### **4. Communication**
Effective communication is critical in any project. Collaborative project management software like Kroolo integrates features like chat, project boards, and comment, threads to facilitate seamless communication among team members. 
This centralized conversation management tool not only streamlines communication, but also supports threaded discussions having replies, forwards, reactions, and file attachments within threads. So, this tool can be an ideal choice if you‚Äôre looking for the perfect [team collaboration in the remote era](https://kroolo.com/blog/team-collaboration-in-the-remote-era-trends-and-tips). 
### **5. Tracking and monitoring**
Waterfall projects involve strict monitoring of progress against the plan. Collaborative project management can provide real-time updates on task completion, allowing project managers to track progress, identify bottlenecks, and make informed decisions.
### **6. Change management**
While waterfall projects typically resist changes once the plan is set, [collaborative tools](https://kroolo.com/blog/reasons-to-choose-online-collaboration-tools) can assist in managing changes more smoothly. Teams can discuss and document change requests and project managers can use collaborative platforms to assess the impact on the project schedule and adjust plans accordingly.
### **7. Integration with other tools**
Collaborative project management software plays a pivotal role in the meticulous planning stages of the waterfall model and in seamlessly integrating with various project tools. 
With 20+ built-in integrations in Kroolo, teams can gain the flexibility to effortlessly update project priorities, statuses, due dates, budgets, and dependencies.
