Kia ora to freelancers, gig workers, and small-scale entrepreneurs! 
Have you ever felt like wrestling while managing documents?
Well, while managing multiple projects, there are higher chances of your documents getting misplaced, lost, or not found at the need of an hour.
M-Files found that 83% of employees will recreate documents if they can’t find them on the company network. This is a waste of time and results in a sheer waste of energy.
Surprisingly, according to a Forrester report commissioned by Adobe, a staggering 97% of organizations had minimal or no digital document processes, and 72% used a mix of paper-based and digital processes. If you can’t invest in the [best document management software](https://kroolo.com/docs), you can't improve your productivity levels. It's high time to switch to the right DMS tool. 
Note that, managing docs is your one-stop shop for easy collaboration and document magic. It isn’t just about creating a doc, but more about editing, storing, and sharing it with the right person at the right time.
## **What is a Document Management Workflow?**
The comprehensive approach an organization takes to handling its documents is called a Document Management Workflow (DMW). It covers a range of processes and activities fundamental to document governance: handling effectively, observing regulations, and reporting regularly. 
So, grab a cup of coffee, relax, manage, and retrieve all your important and [technical documents](https://kroolo.com/blog/how-to-write-technical-documentation-like-an-expert-6-step-by-step-guide) from a unified platform in just one click.

## **What does a Document Management Workflow Consist of?**
Within a [document management workflow](https://kroolo.com/blog/document-management-workflow), several pivotal sub-processes play a significant role. For instance -:
  * **Creation** : This part explains the procedures for producing and drafting new documents. It sets forth standards and best practices that ensure documents are written correctly and effectively from the beginning.
  * **Editing** : The editing phase describes how we improve existing documents, including proofreading, review cycles, and cases of compliance. Its purpose is to avoid errors and make the document scannable.
  * **Categorization** : Here, the focus is on organizing and indexing documents for easy retrieval and browsing. It means arranging documents into logical hierarchies, using folder systems, and adopting nested categories for better classifications.
  * **Sharing** : States the criteria for access to documents, indicating who can view, alter, and share documents. Permissions, collaborative functionalities, and protocols are controlled over documents.
