Work smarter and not harder with [free team management software](https://kroolo.com/blog/teamwork-triumphs-taking-a-closer-look-at-the-benefits-of-workplace-collaboration). Leverage these powerful features -
  * **To-do lists**

  * **Notification**


As a team manager, always notify your team members that they've been assigned a new task. But, don’t do it manually or verbally. This won't be possible in case of large team size. Instead, do it modernly with the latest team management tools that keep you posted when anything is assigned or shared with you. 
  * **Shared tasks**


Do you know that [57% of projects fail due to a breakdown in communications](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312040736_Project_success_and_new_ventures'_outcomes_How_often_do_partners'_potential_benefits_and_losses_really_converge)?
