## 12 Brainstorming Techniques to Implement with Team Productivity Software
Explore these unique [12 brainstorming techniques](https://app.kroolo.com/signup) for measuring the productivity of software development teams and freelancers to fuel innovation & enhance project outcomes -:
### 1. Starbursting
![Team Productivity Software - Starbursting](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/02/20/internal-image-1_jBGkYgc.jpg)
Starbursting is a brainstorming technique that involves asking questions instead of providing solutions. It means that you have to encapsulate an idea or issue with some set of ‚ÄúWh-‚Äù questions‚Äî
  * Who
  * What
  * When
  * Where
  * Why
  * How


First, this method promotes holistic investigation üîçand makes for an overall investigation of different aspects of the given topic. By systematically addressing these queries, teams can identify potential challenges, opportunities, and aspects that may not be immediately obvious.
In short, starbursting strengthens critical thinkingüôá, providing a comprehensive and holistic view of the subject matter that can lead to more informed choices made during the process of creativity.
### 2. **SCAMPER**
![Team Productivity Software - SCAMPER¬†](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/02/20/internal-image-2_idQ1NTN.jpg)
SCAMPER is a creative thinking and brainstorming method aimed at stimulating innovation and the creation of new ideas. SCAMPER is the acronym for various methods of approaching and adjusting an existing idea. Here's what each letter represents:
**1. S - Substitute:** So, consider replacing or substituting one element of the idea with something else.
**2. C - Combine:** Consider different elements or ideas to be combined.
**3. A - Adapt:** Consider how you could adapt your creativity in a completely new environment.
**4. M - Modify:** Think of how some elements of the idea can be adapted or transformed to make it better.
**5. P - Put to Another Use:** Find other ways that the idea can be used or applied.
**6. E - Eliminate:** Identify what parts of the idea could be abandoned or made simpler.
**7. R - Reverse:** Look at the opposite or different aspects of the idea and come up with something fresh.
SCAMPER invites people or teams to see problems or ideas from different angles, stimulating creativity and innovation. It is fluid, and a popular technique used in brainstorming sessions to inspire innovative thinking and come up with breakthrough ideas.
### **3. Round Robin technique**
![Team Productivity Software - Round Robin technique¬†](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/02/20/internal-image-7.jpg)
Round Robin is one of the participatory methods in which participants put forward their ideas in turn, in a rotational way. The team members take turns to air their views to ensure that everybody is considered. 
This structured approach creates an environment of equal participation, where different viewpoints are not only encouraged but also have the same opportunity as everyone else needs to be heard. 
The Round Robin is a useful tool for fostering inclusion and coming up with balanced solutions in[ team discussions](https://kroolo.com/blog/6-useful-tips-for-effective-team-management) and brainstormingüí´.
### **4. Brainwriting**
Brainwriting is an example of a collaborative ideation technique where team members generate ideas in writing‚úç. Instead of traditional brainstorming, individuals write their thoughts about a particular topic on separate sheets of paper.üìÉ
![team productivity software](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/02/06/internal-image-4_RmHy5FF.png)
They secondly share their ideas with others who develop them further. This approach fosters heterogeneous contributions, reduces groupthink, and facilitates concurrent idea generation. 
The advantage of brainwriting is that it promotes creativity and inclusivity in a team, ensuring that plenty of perspectives are taken into account during the ideation process.
### 5. Brain Netting
Imagine you are brainstorming and minds connected like a digital web ‚Äì that‚Äôs nothing but Brain Netting. It is this cool technique of brainstorming in real-time where the minds blend thoughts to weaveüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è into a creative canvas. 
Imagine a virtual room where minds touch, converse, and come up with amazing ideas. 
With Brain netting, the sky is the limitüå® ‚Äì it‚Äôs like having a brainstorming party where ideas are flowing and developing with every click. So, come on as we all gather around the virtual table and weave a web of brilliance together! üß†üï∏Ô∏è
### 6. The Six Thinking Hats
[Edward de Bono](https://www.debonogroup.com/services/core-programs/six-thinking-hats/) invented The Six Thinking Hats as a creative problem-solving technique. It involves approaching a problem or decision from six distinct perspectives, each represented by a metaphorical "thinking hat." These hats are:
![team productivity software](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/02/06/internal-image-3_SOvFutV.png)
**1. White Hat (Facts):** Concentrates on available information, data, and factsüé≤.
**2. Red Hat (Emotions):** Talks about feelings, intuitions, and gut reactions without having to rationalize them.
**3. Black Hat (Critical judgment):** Identifies potential threats, vulnerabilities, and obstacles.
**4. Yellow Hat (Optimism):** Positive characteristics, advantages, and opportunities.
**5. Green Hat (Creativity):** Builds creative thinking, brainstorming new ideas, and investigating alternativesüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
**6. Blue Hat (Control):** Manage the thinking process, lead discussions, and define the agendaüìí.
----
Suppose a freelance graphic designer is stuck when working on a project. Wearing the üé©**‚ÄúGreen Hat‚Äù** (creativity), they develop new ideas and innovative design concepts without group discussion.
Later, at a virtual team meeting they wear the ü§†**‚ÄúBlue Hat‚Äù** (control) together to brainstorm and improve their thoughts collectively. The **‚ÄúRed Hat‚Äù** (emotions) gives the team an option to share their instincts, and the **‚ÄúBlack Hat‚Äù** gives a possibility to analyze possible risks.
**‚ÄúYellow Hat‚Äù** (optimism) suggests accenting strengths. Six Thinking Hats allows freelancers and teams to overcome creative problems effortlessly, supported by comprehensive and efficient decision-making.
### 7. The Gap analysis
Ever dreamed of [goals](https://kroolo.com/blog/goal-management-software) üéØas if they were just out of reach? That‚Äôs where the gap analysis comes to the rescue! 
It‚Äôs like a GPS for success, showing you the area between where you start and where you want to end up. Picture this: You target stellar project delivery, but timelines go over the top. Gap analysis identifies the gap, allows you to tighten the ship up, and voila ‚Äì smoother sailings!‚õµ
It‚Äôs your project superhero, finding the gaps and making sure of a victoryüèÖ. So, next time you size up those targets let the gap be your strategic partner! üöÄüéØ
### 8. How Now Wow Technique 
‚ÄúHow Now Wow‚Äù is an urgent ideas framework that faces immediate needs (‚ÄúNow‚Äù), short-term objectives (‚ÄúHow‚Äù), and long-term vision (‚ÄúWow‚Äù). Freelancers can take advantage of this by linking tasks to their project schedules. 
When combined with Kroolo, a productivity software that includes all project management features, freelancers work on their projects efficiently. 
Kroolo‚Äôs [dashboard](https://kroolo.com/blog/project-management-dashboards-ultimate-guide) enables the organization of tasks in a list or board view, matching perfectly ‚ÄúHow Now Wow‚Äù allows multitasking with the right balance between urgent tasks, short-term objectives, and long-term viewpoints.
### 9. Storming figure 
Storming figure is a brainstorming technique that uses graphsüìà and drawings to provoke creativity. Instead of using their verbal language, team members make use of drawings, diagramsüìä, or infographics to convey and develop ideas collectively. 
This approach facilitates a more visual and intuitive exploration of ideas, promoting understanding among team members. Key aspects of storming forming are -:
  * **Visual expression:** Emphasizes the use of drawings and diagrams.
  * **Enhanced communication:** Helps in clearer communication through pictorial representation.
  * **Creative exploration:** Accelerates innovative thinking that relies on visual creativity.
  * **Collaborative dynamics:** Make team collaboration stronger by visually sharing and contributing to ideas.


### 10. Lightning Decision Jam
LDJ (Lightning Decision Jam) is a fast, systematic ideation process suitable for making quick decisions. It is a short version of design thinkingü§î, enabling teams to come up with ideas, share them, and rank them quickly. 
Through time-boxed activities, LDJ offers focused discussions üë®‚Äçüè´and guards against overthinking. For remote teams, LDJ is a highly effective tool because it facilitates virtual brainstorming among team members from different walks of life. The LDJ methodology includes:
  * **[Time-boxed sessions](https://kroolo.com/blog/timeboxing-a-practical-guide-to-goal-driven-time-management): **Ensures swift decision cycles
