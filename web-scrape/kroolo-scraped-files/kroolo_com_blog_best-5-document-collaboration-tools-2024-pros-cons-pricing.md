Looking for [business document management software](https://kroolo.com/docs) for your team?
In this competitive landscape, productive document collaboration has become the cornerstone of every business. Whether you’re a freelancer, gig worker, or a small business owner, creating, sharing, editing, and organizing docs have become a daily ritual for your business.
That’s the magic wand of document management software.
But with hundreds of document management tools available, how will you select the best one? Well, that’s quite challenging, right?
So, here we have hand-picked some of the best document collaboration tools with detailed pricing. Explore below and make the right choice for enhancing your team’s productivity at the helm -:
## What is Document Collaboration Software? How Does it Work?
An online document collaboration tool is a software that allows several users to simultaneously work on one document or set of documents irrespective of their location. You can manage every piece of information in one central space and organize your data mess in a structured way for quick retrieval. 
Some of the free document management tools such as Kroolo are necessary for effective collaboration, managing different versions of the same documents or ideas, and fostering transparent communication within the group.
**Here's how document collaboration software typically works-**
Most of the document collaboration tools are cloud-based—the documents are kept on a remote server, not on individual computers. Users can always log on to the internet, access, and amend documents at any time.
  * **Cloud-based storage:** The document owner usually invites users to work together on a document or through an access link. Security and privacy are ensured because only the owner may view, edit, or comment on the document.
  * **Real-time editing****:** This allows a lot of users to edit the same document simultaneously. Modifications made by one user are immediately evident for the other users which speeds up cooperation and reduces the problem of versions.
  * **Commenting and discussion****:** The collaboration tool also comes with a comment or chat feature. Users could post discussions for the document or specific changes within the platform.
  * **Version history:** Document collaboration tools usually keep a record of all changes in the document and therefore have a version history. This is helpful when tracking differences between versions, which can help resolve conflict. Users can also go back to the earlier version if necessary.
  * **Notifications and alerts** : Users are normally informed when the changes are incorporated into the document or whenever there are references in comments and discussions. It makes sure that people remain informed and active. Many tools allow for offline work and subsequent synchronization with the server when the connection is restored.
  * **File sharing****:** Most collaboration tools contain a feature for file sharing, which enables file uploading and sharing of a variety of document types such as text files, spreadsheets, presentations, etc.
  * **Integration** : Such software might also integrate with other productivity and communication tools such as emails, calendars, project management software, and chat platforms, to create an all-inclusive platform for document creation and revision.
  * **Security and privacy** : Such tools usually have security features such as encryption, access control, and data banking, so that the integrity and confidentiality of documents are well protected.
