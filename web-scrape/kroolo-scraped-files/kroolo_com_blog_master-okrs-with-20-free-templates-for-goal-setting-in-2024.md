Hey there, Gig Warriors! 
Are you ready to take your game to the next level? 
But, before you need to set your goal and note down your key objectives and expected results. It’s all about applying the OKRs concept in gig work where one has to set goals that they can achieve. [According to Datalligence](http://datalligence.ai/blogs/top-okr-stats/), OKRs can improve the ROI by 10 to 15% when you’ve alignment and priorities clearly defined.
If you’re a genius in designing, an expert in coding, or even a consultant, creating effective OKRs can be the secret behind your success. And guess what? In 2024, we have got your ultimate playbook!
In this article, we’re giving you a feast of about 20+ examples of OKRs across different gig worker types. Let us turn your casual freelancing gig into a symphony of success by [setting effective and SMART OKRs](https://kroolo.com/blog/how-to-write-effective-goals-and-okrs) and marking the milestones.
P.S. Make sure you invest in the right [goal management software](https://kroolo.com/goals) to implement your OKR strategy. 
## **What is OKR?**
OKR, aka Objective & Key result, is a collaborative goal-setting approach that helps businesses execute and achieve their desired results. 
You can use [smart goal management software](https://kroolo.com/blog/best-goal-tracking-software-for-businesses) for preparing OKRs for setting your quarterly, biannual, or annual goals depending on the needs of your business and what your team agrees upon. 
Importantly, remote workers and gig workers use this framework for goal setting as it encourages efficient workflow, streamlines, enables transparent communication and aligns the team with shared company objectives. 
## **5 Key Elements of OKRs**
In an interview with  _Harvard Business Review_ , VC John Doerr revealed that there are superheroes of OKRs. They are spelled out as the acronym “F.A.C.T.S.” Let's understand in detail -:
![superheroes of OKR - kroolo](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/02/13/container_t7foiqr.jpg)
**1. Focus**
The use of key results or [OKRs helps you to focus](https://kroolo.com/blog/10-visualization-techniques-to-achieve-your-goals) on what is essential and should be given much attention. This provides direction to teams or individuals to focus only on what should matter and help everyone achieve their common targets. This enables you to concentrate on tasks and initiatives since there are no other distractions hence increasing your productivity levels. 
**2. Alignment**
Following that, the critical stage of lining up company plans and actions with the overall vision is achieved once top-line objectives are set. These objectives are linked to the daily activities of managers and contributors. 
This aligns all the team members’ activities to promote teamwork and a unified effort towards common objectives. The Harvard Business Review says that when employees of organizations align themselves to their operations, the same organizations may end up performing at the optimal level.
**3. Commitment**
Commitment comes after focus and alignment. Once you and your team have agreed on OKRs, plan your resources and schedules to ensure that they will be delivered as discussed. Keep tracking this commitment to check if any possibility of variance.
Ensure that every team member involved in setting OKRs must keep others posted by using the best goal management software. Also, their progress toward OKRs should be visible to all, promoting transparency regarding each person and group’s contributions.
**4. Tracking**
The crux of OKRs is traceability from output to outcome. Metrics, which ought to have been established while setting the goals, should be used to measure each of the OKRs. However, daily tracking might not be needed but regular check-ins every week. 
This will ensure that goal slippage does not occur. Such regular check-ups keep them on track and allow for continuous assessments with needed corrections.
**5. Stretching**
OKRs push organizations to stretch their boundaries and dream big. These leaders motivate teams towards setting goals that are unreachable unless through hard work. The so-called “stretch goals” championed by some leading personalities in the industry like Larry Page of Google stimulate creative thinking and cause breakthroughs, forcing organizations to set unprecedented targets.
All these make up the strength of OKRs in ensuring corporate success, alignment of activities, building on accountability, and promoting a culture of engagement and openness.
## **Different Types of OKRs**
Different types of OKRs fit different organizations and circumstances. Let's discuss the main bifurcation of OKRs -:
![Different Types of OKRs - kroolo](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/02/13/container1.jpg)
### **1. Company wide OKRs**
Those are strategic goals that supersede the corporate purpose and direction of the company. 
They outline the long-term direction and major objectives that guide all areas of the firm. All employees need to be unitedly headed in the same direction and they should do so to reach common objectives to bring prosperity to your company.
### **2. Team level OKRs**
Team-level OKRs may also be for the individual departments, or teams within each department that align to the overall objectives of the business. 
The team’s OKRs are more departmentalized and contribute towards the overall organizational objectives. These ensure that the efforts of all teams are coordinated towards a specific purpose which ultimately leads towards a common goal.
### **3. Individual OKRs**
Individually, workers are empowered to stipulate their own objectives or key results (OKRs) that match the targets of the team and the organization as well. These are individualized and kept in detail like - what each individual must accomplish in order to participate in team and company goals. 
Thus, OKRs are perfectly fitted like an alignment mechanism between individual growth and development and organizational goals, instilling accountability and involvement of each team member in the quest for success.
