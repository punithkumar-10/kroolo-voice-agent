**1. Increased productivity**
AI-driven automation can save time on manual tasks, enabling teams to focus on higher-value activities. [According to McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/Digital%20Disruption/Harnessing%20automation%20for%20a%20future%20that%20works/MGI-A-future-that-works-Executive-summary.ashx), automation technologies could increase productivity growth globally by 0.8% to 1.4% annually. Implementing AI in project management could contribute significantly to this increase.
**2. Improved decision-making**
AI can provide valuable insights and recommendations based on data analysis, enabling better-informed decision-making. A [study by Pwc](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/cloud-digital/data-analytics.html) found that companies that use data-driven decision-making are 5% more productive and 6% more profitable than their competitors.
**3. Automation of routine tasks**
AI can [automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks](https://kroolo.com/blog/task-automation-software-improves-productivity) such as scheduling, reporting, and data entry, freeing up valuable time and resources for more strategic initiatives. This allows organizations to streamline their workflows, increase operational efficiency, and focus on high-impact activities that drive growth.
**4. Continuous improvement**
AI-driven insights and analytics enable organizations to continuously evaluate and optimize their [project management processes](https://kroolo.com/blog/project-management-process). By leveraging AI-generated recommendations and best practices, organizations can refine their approach over time, leading to continuous improvement and sustained growth.
**5. Cost savings**
By improving efficiency, productivity, and project outcomes, AI in project management can lead to significant cost savings for organizations. [According to Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/our-thinking/insights/topics/talent/technology-and-the-future-of-work/intelligent-automation-2022-survey-results.html), companies that invest in AI technology can achieve cost savings of up to 30% within three to five years.
