# Cookie Policy
This Cookie Policy explains how we use cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website. We value your privacy and want to be transparent about the data we collect and how it is used.
## **What are cookies?**
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device when you visit a website. They are commonly used to make websites work more efficiently and provide information to website owners.
## **How We Use Cookies**
We use cookies and similar tracking technologies for various purposes, including:
Essential Cookies: These cookies are necessary for the website to function properly. They enable you to navigate around the website and use its features.
Performance Cookies: These cookies collect information about how visitors use our website, such as which pages are most frequently visited. This helps us improve the website's performance and user experience.
Functional Cookies: These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make, such as language preferences and customization settings, to provide a more personalized experience.
Analytical Cookies: We use third-party analytical tools that set cookies to gather information about the use of our website. These cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our website, which pages are most popular, and other usage patterns. We use this information to improve our website and user experience.
## **Third Party Cookies**
We may also use third-party cookies, such as those from Google Analytics, to collect statistical information about your use of our website. These cookies are used to analyze and optimize the performance and user experience of the website. The information collected is aggregated and does not personally identify you.
## **Cookie Settings**
You may also manage your cookie settings via your browser settings or through our cookie banner.
Here, you may clear or block specific cookies, such as third party cookies, or all cookies. However, if you block all of the cookies that we use, it may affect your user experience.
To adjust your cookie settings via your browser, you should go to your browser settings.
If you choose to clear all cookies, your website and your website preferences may be lost, including your ability to opt-out of enabling cookies as this function itself requires the placement of a cookie on your device.
## **Consent to Cookies**
Our Cookie banner allows you to provide your consent by accepting the use of cookies and to adjust your cookie preferences.
You may revoke the use of non-essential cookies at any time through the cookie banner.
You may also decline the use of non-essential cookies.
## **Changes to this Cookie Policy**
We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes in technology, data protection laws, and our practices. Any changes will be posted on this page.
## **Other User-tracking Technologies**
Tracking pixels, also known as web beacon, marketing pixel, conversion pixel, retargeting pixel, and sometimes just pixels are like cookies but differ in that they are a small snippet of HTML that allows us to gain insights for marketing purposes. Unlike cookies, tracking pixels have the ability to send information directly to a web server.
Tracking pixels allow us to learn more about interest in our website and products by providing data on use numbers, time and date of web visits and web page usage.
It is not possible to opt-out of tracking pixels. However, because tracking pixels are used together with cookies, you may limit their usage by deleting cookies or adjusting your cookie settings.
