Planning to expand your 6-figure agencyüíµ?
But, are you using any [SaaS project management techniques](https://kroolo.com/projects) and tools?
If you're not utilizing [online project management software](https://kroolo.com/blog/best-project-management-software), you're likely spending significant time on minor tasksüìö and investing more effort than required. According to [PMI Pulse](http://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/learning/thought-leadership/pulse/pmi-pulse-2020-final.pdf), companies that use project management software to plan a mature delivery process are more likely to meet their goals. 
Moreover, the benefits of leveraging the SaaS project management software are limitless. Until recently, project management software was represented by three elements: a pencil, a piece of paper, and a specific approach.
In today's fast-paced digital landscape, efficient project management has become the foundation of success. To navigate the complexities of modern projects, organizations are increasingly turning to project management software techniquesüèµ.
Let‚Äôs discuss some benefits of project management techniques that no one talks about -: 
## Why You Should Leverage SaaS Project Management Software Techniques
Utilizing the [best productivity management software](https://kroolo.com/blog/11-best-productivity-software-for-mac-users-to-try-in-2024)[ ](https://kroolo.com/)can greatly help your organization and improve your project management procedures on multiple fronts. Here are three key reasons why you should consider adopting project management software - 
### (A) Efficiency and productivity
[Project management software](https://kroolo.com/blog/how-ai-based-project-management-software-transform-workflows) eases project workflows by enabling the planning, execution, and tracking of these projects. It automates typical chores, collects project data and makes it possible to observe all the changes in the project in real time. 
This also leads to a higher level of efficiency and consequently increased productivity where teams will be able to concentrate on the value-added functions rather than on manual administrative work. 
### (B) Collaboration and communication
Project success relies on effective communication and collaborationü§ù. This includes the functionalities of assigning tasks, sharing files, real-time chats, and forum-based discussions which promote effective communication among project teams‚Äô members.
This ensures that everyone is on the same page and minimizes the possibility of disputes & conflictsüë¨. 
### (C) Data-driven decision making
Project management software provides data and analytics that help the business make a data-driven decisionü§î. It lets you track project progress, [monitor key performance indicators (KPIs)](https://kroolo.com/blog/strategic-guide-kpis-vs-metrics-in-goal-management), and generate reports to give you an understanding of the project‚Äôs health and performance. 
Having this information handy would enable you to make wise decisions, detect issues early, and improve your project management procedures continuously.

## 7 Proven SaaS Project Management Techniques and Tools
Here, we‚Äôve discussed seven proven project management techniques and tools that can help improve your project's successüë®‚Äçüéì and efficiency to a greater extent:- 
### 1. Agile methodology
In an ever-evolving business landscape, agility is essential. Agile project management techniques like Scrum or Kanban offer flexibility and iterative approaches. The [SaaS project management software](https://app.kroolo.com/signup) often supports these practices by providing features tailored to agile methodologies, enabling teams to adapt to changing requirements more effectively. Here's how agility is integrated into project management techniques and tools -
  * **Iterative planning**


Instead of rigidly defining the entire project scope upfront, [agile project management](https://kroolo.com/blog/agile-release-planning-made-easy-unlocking-the-potential-of-incremental-task-releases) emphasizes iterative planning. Teams break down the project into smallerüìï, manageable parts called "sprints" or "iterations." Businesses can leverage this approach for adjustments and refinements based on ongoing feedback üì¢and changing requirements.
  * **Scrum framework**


Scrum is a popular agile framework that divides work into time-boxed iterations (sprints). As an agency, you can use this framework to manage your daily stand-up meetingsüë®‚Äçüíª, sprint planning, and sprint reviews. These practices enhance communication and facilitate the team's ability to respond to changes quickly.
  * **Kanban boards**


Kanban is a visual tool that helps teams manage work tasks. It uses a board with columns representing different stages of work, such as "To-Do", "In Progress", and "Done". Tasks move across these columns as they progressüöÄ.
![saas project management techniques ](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/02/12/kro_49_manage_projecs_in_kanban-view.gif)
  * **Continuous feedback**


Agile methodologies promote regular communication and feedback loops‚ôª among team members, stakeholders, and customers. You get ongoing dialogue that enables quick identification of issues, alignment on priorities, and adjustments based on changing requirements.
### 2. Gantt charts
Visual representation is a powerful tool for project management. Gantt Charts, as part of project management techniques and tools, enhance planning, execution, and monitoring processes. It transforms complex project details into an accessible format that aids in efficient coordination, better decision-making, and successful project completion.
  * **Task dependencies**


Gantt chart allows for the identification of task dependencies ‚Äì which tasks need to be completed before others can startüè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø. This helps prevent bottlenecks and delays, ensuring smoother project flow.
  * **Visual clarity**


Gantt Charts offer a clear and intuitive visualization of project schedules. They present tasks and their durations along a timeline, making it easier to understand the project's overall scope and progression.
### 3. Risk management
Risk is an inherent part of any project. Project management software techniques include risk management tools that help teams identify and assess potential risksüî¥. It involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential threats and uncertainties that could impact a project's success. 
By proactively addressing risks, teams can develop strategies to minimize their impact, enhance decision-making, and maintain project objectives within established timelines and budgets. By developing mitigation strategies, organizations can minimize the impact of threats, ensuring smoother project execution.
### 4. Collaboration and communication
Project management tools and techniques play a crucial role in ensuring [effective collaboration and communication](https://kroolo.com/blog/teamwork-triumphs-taking-a-closer-look-at-the-benefits-of-workplace-collaboration) within a project team. They provide structure, transparency, and organization to the project, which in turn helps teams work together more efficiently and communicate effectively.
Here's how project management tools and techniques contribute to these aspects:-
  * **Centralized information**


Project management tools provide a central hub for all project-related information. This includes project goalsüéØ, tasks, timelines, resources, and documents. Having a centralized repository ensures that team members have access to the most up-to-date information, reducing confusion and miscommunication.
  * **Real-time updates**


Modern project management tools often offer real-time updates and notifications. Team members receive alerts about task updates, or any changes in deadlines, and other important project-related information to keep everyone posted. 
  * **Collaborative workspaces**


Project management tools provide [collaborative workspaces](https://kroolo.com/blog/7-benefits-of-having-workspace-management-tools-in-2024) where team members can discuss tasks, share files, and provide feedback. These spaces facilitate ongoing discussionsüó£, brainstorming, and problem-solving among team members, even if they are geographically dispersed.
### 5. Document management
Managing project-related documents is crucial for maintaining organization and version control. Project management software techniques provide solutions for centralizing and [organizing documents](https://kroolo.com/blog/how-to-write-technical-documentation-like-an-expert-6-step-by-step-guide), ensuring easy access and collaboration. This leads to efficient knowledge sharing and reduced document-related bottlenecks.
![saas project management techniques ](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/02/12/how-to-create-a-document-using-kroolo-ai-gif-1.gif)
  * **Centralized document repository**


According to [Cottrill Research,](https://cottrillresearch.com/various-survey-statistics-workers-spend-too-much-time-searching-for-information/) 19.8 percent of business time ‚Äì the equivalent of one day per working weeküë©‚Äçüè´ ‚Äì is wasted by employees searching for information to do their jobs effectively.
Shift to a powerful [document management system](https://kroolo.com/blog/6-practices-to-optimize-document-management-workflow). It provides a centralized repository for storing and organizing project documents. This repository ensures that all team members have access to the latest versions of documents, reducing the risk of confusion and errors caused by outdated information.
  * **Version control**


Most project management tools offer version control features, allowing team members to track document changes and revisionsüìù. This feature helps avoid confusion over which version of a document is the most up-to-date and provides an audit trail for accountability.
  * **AI model**


Kroolo's Kroo AI let's you create goals and tasks, documents, and projects just by entering a prompt. You can leverage this to summarize, brainstorm, re-generate text, or continue writing with the power of AI. 
### 6. Reporting and analytics
Data-driven decision-making is the bedrock of successful project management. Project management software offers robust reporting and analytics features that generate comprehensive insights into project performance. By analyzing this data, organizations can identify areas for improvement and refine their business strategies.
### 7. Integration with other tools
Project management software allows integration with various tools like - customer relationship management (CRM) software, accounting software, [document management systems](https://kroolo.com/blog/best-document-management-software), and more to streamline your workflow and keep your team connected. Such integrations are essential in managing, tracking, and facilitating centralizing project data. 
Aggregating data from different sources and systems within one project management platform gives you access to a unified repository of information. Thus, this centralization simplifies reporting and analysis to make informed decisions based on your project‚Äôs status and performance.
