---|---|---  
**1. Cycle Time** |  Cycle Time = Total Time Taken / Number of Cycles |  Measures the time required to complete a task or process. Lower cycle time indicates higher efficiency.  
**2. Velocity** |  Velocity = Total Story Points Completed / Number of Sprints |  Measures the amount of work completed in a sprint. A higher velocity reflects better productivity over time.  
**3. Lead Time** |  Lead Time = Completion Date - Start Date |  Measures the total time taken from task initiation to completion. Shorter lead time indicates improved efficiency.  
**4. Defect Density** |  Defect Density = Total Number of Defects / Size of Codebase (KLOC) |  Measures the number of defects per unit of code. Lower defect density indicates better code quality.  
**5. Deployment Frequency** |  Deployment Frequency = Total Deployments / Time Period |  Tracks the number of times code is deployed to production. More frequent deployments indicate better CI/CD efficiency.  
**6. Test Coverage** |  Test Coverage = (Number of Lines Tested / Total Lines of Code) × 100 |  Measures the percentage of code covered by automated tests. Higher coverage reduces bugs in production.  
**7. Escaped Defects** |  Escaped Defects = (Defects Found in Production / Total Defects Found) × 100 |  Measures the percentage of defects found in production after release. Lower percentage means better pre-release testing.  
**8. Employee Utilization Rate** |  Utilization Rate = (Time Spent on Productive Work / Total Available Time) × 100 |  Tracks how much of an engineer's time is spent on productive work. A balanced rate helps avoid burnout.  
![how to improve engineering productivity](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/11/19/ball-point-game.png)
### **1. Cycle Time**
Cycle time measures the duration required to complete a specific task or process, tracked from start to finish.
**Formula to measure cycle time:**
Cycle Time = Total Time Taken / Number of Cycles
**Example:** Suppose a team completes 10 tasks over 15 working days.
Cycle Time = 15 working days / 10 tasks = 1.5 working days per task.
Shorter cycle times indicate higher efficiency.
### **2. Velocity**
Velocity measures the number of story points or tasks completed by a team during a sprint.
**Formula to measure velocity:**
Velocity = Total Story Points Completed / Number of Sprints
**Example:** If a team completes 40 story points across 2 sprints:
Velocity = 40 story points / 2 sprints = 20 story points per sprint.
Higher velocity reflects better productivity over time.
### **3. Lead Time**
Lead time measures the total time taken from task initiation to completion.
**Formula to measure lead time:**
Lead Time = Completion Date - Start Date
**Example:** A task started on January 1 and finished on January 10:
Lead Time = 10 days - 1 day = 9 days.
Shorter lead times demonstrate improved efficiency.
### **4. Defect Density**
Defect density measures the number of defects per unit of code.
**Formula to measure defect density:**
Defect Density = Total Number of Defects / Size of Codebase (KLOC or Function Points)
**Example:**
If 15 defects are found in 5000 lines of code:
Defect Density = 15 / 5 = 3 defects per KLOC.
Lower defect density indicates better code quality.
### **5. Deployment Frequency**
Deployment frequency tracks the number of times code is deployed to production over a specific period.
**Formula to measure deployment frequency:**
Deployment Frequency = Total Deployments / Time Period
**Example:**
If a team deploys 12 times in a month:
Deployment Frequency = 12 deployments / 1 month = 12 deployments per month.
Higher frequency indicates efficient CI/CD pipelines.
### **6. Test Coverage**
Test coverage measures the percentage of code covered by automated tests.
**Formula to measure test coverage:**
Test Coverage = (Number of Lines Tested / Total Lines of Code) × 100
**Example:**
If 800 lines of code are covered out of 1000 total lines:
Test Coverage = (800 / 1000) × 100 = 80%.
Higher test coverage reduces the risks of bugs in production.
### **7. Escaped Defects**
Escaped defects measure the number of bugs found after a product is released.
**Formula to measure escaped defects:**
Escaped Defects = (Defects Found in Production / Total Defects Found) × 100
**Example:**
If 5 defects are found in production out of 20 total defects:
Escaped Defects = (5 / 20) × 100 = 25%.
Lower percentages indicate robust testing.
### **8. Employee Utilization Rate**
This measures the percentage of time an engineer spends on productive tasks.
**Formula to measure utilization rate:**
Utilization Rate = (Time Spent on Productive Work / Total Available Time) × 100
**Example:**
If an engineer spends 30 hours on productive tasks out of 40 available hours in a week:
Utilization Rate = (30 / 40) × 100 = 75%.
Balanced utilization rates help avoid burnout while maintaining productivity.
