## **When to Create AI Agents?**
**![Custom AI agents](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/05/30/ball-point-game_W6zH04r.png)**
## Understanding the Forms of AI Agents
![Understanding The Concept: What Is An Agent In AI? - Neurond AI](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/09/19/ball-point-game.png)
**1. Single Agents**
A single agent operates independently in an environment, performing tasks based on its programmed goals and the inputs it receives. It interacts with the environment to solve problems or complete tasks without needing other agents.
**Example** : A chatbot that answers customer questions on its own, without collaboration from other AI systems.
**2. Multi-Agents**
Multi-agent systems consist of multiple AI agents that work together or independently to achieve a shared objective. These agents can communicate, coordinate, or compete with one another depending on the system's goals.
**Example** : A team of AI-driven robots working together in a warehouse to sort, package, and deliver products.
**3. Hybrid Agents**
Hybrid agents combine the strengths of both single and multi-agent systems. They can function autonomously like single agents but can also collaborate and share tasks when necessary, often blending reactive and proactive behaviors to adapt to different environments.
**Example** : A customer service AI that handles basic inquiries independently but escalates complex issues to another specialized agent or team for resolution.
## **5 Best Practices for Building Custom AI Agents**
