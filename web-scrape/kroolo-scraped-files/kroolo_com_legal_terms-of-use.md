## **5. Workspaces**
User Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into “Workspaces”, as deemed fit as per your needs, and managed by you. 
In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s) and your employer’s Organizational Workspace. Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer Content from one Workspace to another). 
Users that join an Organizational Workspace agree that their account data and User Content created in that Workspace may be shared with that Organization and may be accessed, modified, or deleted by the Workspace owner or administrator. Further, you acknowledge and agree that if you register with an email address provisioned by an Organization (“Organization Email”), you agree that such Organization may be able to view information about any Workspace you create or for which you are an administrator, including a list of Workspace members, and guests and Content.

When using the API you should follow our relevant developer guidelines. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your and / or Customer’s access to the API (or any part of it) with or without notice.

## **8. Subscription and Billing**
Some parts of the Service, including Add-ons, are made available on a paid subscription basis ("Subscription"). Pricing and included features for the Subscriptions (“Payment Plan”) as defined in our Websites. “Subscription Fees” means all fees associated with your Subscription.
You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing Cycles are set on a monthly or yearly basis. Whether you are using monthly or yearly billing, your account may be charged on a monthly basis. 
Auto-Renewal: You agree that at the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew and your payment method for such Subscription will automatically be charged at the start of each new Subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that Billing Cycle, under the same conditions as the prior Billing Cycle unless you cancel your Subscription prior to your renewal date.
A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You must provide Kroolo with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Kroolo to charge all Subscription Fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Kroolo may attempt to charge the credit card on file one or more times. Should payment continue to fail, the Subscription will be, at Kroolo’s sole discretion, canceled or downgraded and you may lose access to certain paid features and/or your Workspace and Kroolo account.
You may cancel your Subscription either through your online account management page or by contacting Kroolo customer support team at team@makeKroolo.com and indicating your intention to cancel your Subscription.
### **Fees and Fee Changes**
Kroolo, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription Fees for the Subscriptions, including Add-Ons. Any Subscription Fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
We will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription Fees.Your continued use of the Service constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription Fees.
Subscription Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, accessible by any jurisdiction (collectively, “Taxes”). You will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your Subscription, except for those taxes based on our net income. Should any payment for the Service be subject to withholding tax by any government, you will reimburse us for such withholding tax.
### **Free Trial**
Kroolo may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial"). If you are on a Free Trial, you may cancel at any time until the last day of your Free Trial by following the cancellation procedures outlined in the Subscription section of these Terms. If you or Kroolo cancel your Free Trial, you acknowledge and agree that we may delete all of your User Content or data associated with the Workspace that was assigned to your Free Trial. If you do not cancel your Free Trial, then your Free Trial will be converted to a paid Subscription at the end of the trial period, and you hereby authorize us to charge your credit card or other payment method for continued use of the paid Service under such Subscription. Thereafter your Subscription may be canceled in accordance with the Section 6 (Subscription) of these Terms.
At any time and without notice, Kroolo reserves the right to (a) modify the terms and conditions of any Free Trial offer; (b) cancel any Free Trial offer; or (c) cancel any Free Trial Subscription at any time.
### **Refunds**
Payment obligations are non-cancelable, and fees paid are non-refundable and there are no credits for partially used Subscription periods.
### **Subscription Term**
The Service is provided on a subscription basis for the term specified in our platform or Order Form, in accordance with the respective subscription plan purchased under such Order Form (the “Subscription Term” and the “Subscription Plan”, respectively, and collectively the “Subscription”).
### **Subscription Fees**
In consideration for the provision of the Service (except for Trial Service), Customer shall pay us the applicable fees per the purchased Subscription, as set forth on our platform (the “Subscription Fees”). Unless indicated otherwise, Subscription Fees are stated in US dollars. Customer hereby authorizes us, either directly or through our payment processing service or our affiliates, to charge such Subscription Fees via Customer’s selected payment method, upon due date. Unless expressly set forth herein, the Subscription Fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable. We reserve the right to change the Subscription Fees at any time, upon notice to Customer if such change may affect Customer’s existing subscriptions upon renewal. In the event of failure to collect the Fees owed by Customer, we may, at our sole discretion (but shall not be obligated to) retry to collect at a later time, and/or suspend or cancel the Account, without notice.
### **Taxes**
The Subscription Fees are exclusive of any and all taxes (including without limitation, value added tax, sales tax, use tax, excise, goods and services tax, etc.), levies, or duties, which may be imposed in respect of these Terms and the purchase or sale, of the Service hereunder (the “Taxes”), except for Taxes imposed on our income. If Customer is located in a jurisdiction which requires Customer to deduct or withhold Taxes or other amounts from any amounts due to us, please notify us, in writing, promptly and we shall join efforts to avoid any such Tax withholding, provided, however, that in any case, Customer shall bear the sole responsibility and liability to pay such Tax and such Tax should be deemed as being added on top of the Subscription Fees, payable by Customer.
### **Subscription Upgrade**
During the Subscription Term, Customer may upgrade its Subscription Plan by either: (i) adding Authorized Users; (ii) upgrading to a higher type of Subscription Plan; (iii) adding add-on features and functionalities; and/or (iv) upgrading to a longer Subscription Term (collectively, “Subscription Upgrades”). Some Subscription Upgrades or other changes may be considered as a new purchase, hence will restart the Subscription Term and some won’t, as indicated within the Service and/or the Order Form. Upon a Subscription Upgrade, Customer will be billed for the applicable increased amount of Subscription Fees, at our then-current rates (unless indicated otherwise in an Order Form), either: (1) prorated for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term, or (2) whenever the Subscription Term is being restarted due to the Subscription Upgrade, then the Subscription Fees already paid by Customer will be reduced from the new upgraded Subscription Fees, and the difference shall be due and payable by Customer upon the date on which the Subscription Upgrade was made.
### **Adding Users**
Customer acknowledges that unless it disabled these options: (i) Users within the same email domain will be able to automatically join the Account; and (ii) Users within Customer’s Account may invite other persons to be added to the Account as Users (collectively, “Add Users”). For further information on these options and how to disable them, visit our Help Center. Unless agreed otherwise in an Order Form, any changes to the number of Users within a certain Account, shall be billed on a prorated basis for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term. We will bill Customer, either upon the Users Increase or at the end of the applicable month, as communicated to Customer.
### **Excessive Usage**
We shall have the right, including without limitation where we, at our sole discretion, believe that Customer and/or any of its Users, have misused the Service or otherwise use the Service in an excessive manner compared to the anticipated standard use (at our sole discretion), to offer the Subscription in different pricing and/or impose additional restrictions as for the upload, storage, download and use of the Service, including, without limitation, restrictions on Third Party Services, network traffic and bandwidth, size and/or length of content, quality and/or format of content, sources of content, volume of download time, etc.
### **Billing**
As part of registering, or submitting billing information, to the Service, Customer agrees to provide us with updated, accurate and complete billing information, and Customer authorizes us (either directly or through our affiliates, including Kroolo or other third parties) to charge, request and collect payment (or otherwise charge, refund or take any other billing actions) from Customer’s payment method or designated banking account, and to make any inquiries that we (or our affiliates and/or third-parties acting on our behalf) may consider necessary to validate Customer’s designated payment account or financial information, in order to ensure prompt payment, including for the purpose of receiving updated payment details from Customer’s credit card company or banking account (e.g.,updated expiry date or card number as may be provided to us by Customer’s credit card company).
### **Subscription Auto-Renewal**
In order to ensure that Customer will not experience any interruption or loss of services, Customer’s Subscription includes an automatic renewal option by default, according to which, unless Customer disables the auto-renewal option or cancels its Subscription prior to its expiration, the Subscription will automatically renew upon the end of the then applicable Subscription Term, for a renewal period equal in time to the original Subscription Term (excluding extended periods) and, unless otherwise notified to Customer, at the same price (subject to applicable Tax changes and excluding any discount or other promotional offer provided for the first Subscription Term). Accordingly, unless either Customer or us cancel the Subscription prior to its expiration, we will attempt to automatically charge Customer the applicable Subscription Fees upon or immediately prior to the expiration of the then applicable Subscription Term. If Customer wishes to avoid such auto-renewal, Customer shall cancel its Subscription (or disable the auto-renewal option), prior to its expiration, at any time through the Account settings or by contacting our Customer Success team. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, in case a Customer cancels its Subscription, during a Subscription Term, the Subscription will not renew for an additional period, but Customer will not be refunded or credited for any unused period within the Subscription Term.
### **Discounts and Promotions**
Unless expressly stated otherwise in a separate legally binding agreement, if Customer received a special discount or other promotional offer, Customer acknowledges that upon renewal of its Subscription, Kroolo will renew such Subscription, at the full applicable Subscription Fee at the time of renewal.
### **Credits**
Any credits that may accrue to Customer’s Account, for any reason (the “Credits”), will expire and be of no further force and effect, upon the earlier of: (i) the expiration or termination of the applicable Subscription under the Account for which such Credits were given; or (ii) in case such Credits accrued for an Account with a Trial Subscription (as defined below) that was not upgraded to a Subscription Plan, then upon the lapse of 90 days of such Credits’ accrual. Unless specifically indicated otherwise, Credits may be used to pay for the Services only and not for any Third Party Service or other payment of whatsoever kind. Whenever fees are due for any Services, accrued Credits will be first reduced against the Subscription Fees and the remainder will be charged from Customer’s respective payment method. Credits shall have no monetary value (except for the purchase of Services under the limited terms specified herein) nor exchange value, and will not be transferable or refundable.
**Refunds**
If Customer is not satisfied with its initial purchase of a Service, Customer may terminate such Service by providing us a written notice, within 30 days of having first ordered such Services (the “Refund Period”). In the event that Customer terminates such initial purchase of a Service, within the Refund Period, we will refund Customer the pro rata portion of any unused and unexpired Subscription Fees pre-paid by Customer in respect of such terminated period of the Subscription, unless such other sum is required by applicable law, in the same currency we were originally paid (the “Refund”). The Refund is applicable only to the initial purchase of the Service by Customer and does not apply to any additional purchases, upgrades, modification or renewals of such Service. Please note that we shall not be responsible to Refund any differences caused by change of currency exchange rates or fees that Customer was charged by third parties, such as wire transfer fees. After the Refund Period, the Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-cancellable. To the extent permitted by law, if we find that a notice of cancellation has been given in bad faith or in an illegitimate attempt to avoid payment for Services actually received and enjoyed, we reserve our right to reject Customer’s Refund request. Subject to the foregoing, upon termination by Customer under this Section 9, all outstanding payment obligations shall immediately become due for the used Subscription Term and Customer will promptly remit to Kroolo any fees due to Kroolo under these Terms.

## **13. Term and Termination**
### **Term**
These Terms are in full force and effect, commencing upon the Effective Date, until the end of the Service underlying the Account, either paid or unpaid, unless terminated otherwise in accordance with these Terms.
### **Termination for Cause**
Either Customer or us may terminate the Service and these Terms, upon written notice, in case that (a) the other party is in material breach of these Terms and to the extent, curable, fails to cure such breach, within a reasonable cure period, which shall not be less than 10 days following a written notice from the non-breaching party; or (b) ceases its business operations or becomes subject to insolvency proceedings and the proceedings are not dismissed within 60 days.
### **Termination by Customer**
Customer may terminate its Subscription to the Service by canceling the Service and/or deleting the Account, whereby such termination shall not derogate from Customer’s obligation to pay applicable Subscription Fees except where such termination is made within the Refund Period. In accordance with Section 9 above, unless mutually agreed otherwise by Customer and us in a written instrument, the effective date of such termination will take effect at the end of the then-current Subscription Term, and Customer’s obligation to pay the Subscription Fees throughout the end of such Subscription Term shall remain in full force and effect, and Customer shall not be entitled to a refund for any pre-paid Subscription Fees.
### **Effect of Termination of Service**
Upon termination or expiration of these Terms, Customer’s Subscription and all rights granted to you hereunder shall terminate, and we may change the Account’s web address. It is Customer’s sole liability to export the Customer Data prior to such termination or expiration. In the event that Customer did not delete the Customer Data from the Account, we may continue to store and host it until either Customer or we, at our sole discretion, delete such Customer Data within 90 days. Customer acknowledges the foregoing and its sole responsibility to export and/or delete the Customer Data prior to the termination or expiration of these Terms, and therefore we shall not have any liability either to Customer, nor to any User or third party, in connection thereto. Unless expressly indicated herein otherwise, the termination or expiration of these Terms shall not relieve Customer from its obligation to pay due Subscription Fees.
### **Suspension**
Without derogating from our termination rights above, we may decide to temporarily suspend the Account and/or a User Profile (including any access thereto) and/or our Service, in the following events: (i) we believe, at our sole discretion, that you or any third party, are using the Service in a manner that may impose a security risk, may cause harm to us or any third party, and/or may raise any liability for us or any third party; (ii) we believe, at our sole discretion, that you or any third party, are using the Service in breach of these Terms or applicable Law; (iii) Customer’s payment obligations, in accordance with these Terms, are or are likely to become, overdue; or (iv) Customer’s or any of its Users’ breach of the Acceptable Use Polic[y](https://monday.com/terms/aup). The afore-mentioned suspension rights are in addition to any remedies that may be available to us in accordance with these Terms and/or applicable Law.

If Kroolo specifies that the modifications to the Agreement will take effect prior to Customer’s next renewal and Customer notifies Kroolo of its objection to the modifications within 30 days after the date of such notice, Kroolo (at its option and as Customer’s exclusive remedy) will either: (a) permit Customer to continue under the existing version of this Agreement until expiration of the then-current Subscription Term (after which time the modified Agreement will go into effect) or (b) allow Customer to terminate this Agreement and receive a refund of any prepaid Service fees allocable to the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term.
