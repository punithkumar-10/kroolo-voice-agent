Ever wonder how to keep the team spirit alive when everyone's miles apart?ü§î
In an era where remote worküíª has become the norm rather than the exception, [team-building activities](https://kroolo.com/blog/12-brainstorming-techniques-boost-collaboration-team-productivity-software) for virtual teams have soared in significance.
[65% of remote employees reported](https://www.teambonding.com/5-team-bondingtips-for-remote-employees) that they have never had a team-building sessionüßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë, the need for effective and engaging virtual team-building strategies is more crucial than ever. That's where virtual team-building activities swoop in to save the dayüåÄ.
Utilizing sophisticated [software for team management](https://kroolo.com/features/teams) not only facilitates these activities but also helps in tracking progressüíπ, engagement, and the overall impact on team dynamics.
Such software and activities pave the way for creating a cohesive and productive environment, despite the physical distance between team membersüëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Okay, so let's discuss these in detail-:
## **What is Virtual Team Building?**
Virtual team building refers to activities and strategies designed to foster camaraderieüßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë, collaboration, and morale among remote team membersüòâ.
It involves engaging in [interactive exercises & games](https://kroolo.com/blog/11-agile-games-to-boost-performance-with-team-productivity-software), and discussions conducted through online platforms to promote communicationüì≤, trust, and team cohesion despite any geographical distance.
[![software for team management](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/02/28/7.png)](https://app.kroolo.com/signup?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=CTA&utm_content=10-virtual-team-building-activities-with-software-for-team-management)
## **10 Virtual Team Building Activities with Software for Team Management**
Building a strong team dynamic is crucial for virtual teams to enhance collaboration, communication, and overall productivity. Here are five team-building activities tailored for virtual teams:-
### **1. Two truths and a lie**
![Software for Team Management](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/04/05/kroolo.jpg)
  * **Type of game** : Conversational starter
  * **Time required** : 15 minutes


In this activity, team members take turns revealing interesting facts about themselves. Two of the statements are true‚úÖ, while one is false‚ùå.
With [Kroolo](https://app.kroolo.com/signup), effortlessly add remote team members, define roles, and customize team settingsüé≤, creating dedicated and [personalized workspaces](https://kroolo.com/blog/7-benefits-of-having-workspace-management-tools-in-2024) for interactive activities. The seamless onboarding process facilitated by Kroolo ensures that new members can quickly integrate into the team, enhancing participation and collaborationüì≥.
### **2. Messy fridays**
  * **Type of game:** Asynchronous**;** just for fun
  * **Time required:** 5 minutes


When you're in an officeüè´, there's this unspoken rule to keep your desk tidy. But when you work from home, there's no one there to judge if your workspace is a bit messy.
![Software for Team Management](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/02/28/kro_41_create_channel-2nd.gif)
So, with Kroolo‚Äôs channel, you can have this thing called let's say ‚Äúmessy Friday‚Äù. On Fridays, ask your remote and in-house team to share picturesüì∏ of your messy desks and laugh about it with emojis likeüòÇ andü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. It's also a chance for super neat people to show off their perfectly [organized workspaces](https://kroolo.com/blog/remote-work-desk-organization-tips). 
Sharing picturesüì∫of messy desks creates a sense of camaraderie as team members realize they're not alone in having a less-than-perfect workspace.üòÅ
### **3. Never have I ever**
![Software for Team Management](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/04/05/kroolo-1.png)
  * **Type of game:** Social Icebreaker/Team-Building
  * **Time required:** Typically 30-60 minutes, depending on the number of participants and the depth of discussion 


In the virtual "Never Have I Ever" game, team gathered on a video callüé•, and we took turns sharing interesting statements related to both personal and professional experiences. 
For instance, someone started with "Never have I ever worked in a different country," and team members who had that experience turned on their videoüìΩÔ∏èto share brief anecdotes about their international work stints.
This not only provided a glimpse into our diverse professional backgrounds but also created a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphereüçπ, encouraging everyone to share unique aspects of their lives. 
### **4. Secret santa**
**![siftware for team management](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/02/28/giphy-secret-santa.gif)**
  * **Type of game:** Team building
  * **Time required:** Duration varies depending on the process of organizing and execution


Participants sign upüì©, sharing their interests and preferences, and are then randomly assigned a "Secret santa" through a virtual platform. 
The anonymity of the gift giver is maintained until the virtual exchange event, during which team members unwrap their thoughtfulüí≠presents on a video call. The excitement builds as participants guess who their secret santa might be based on the giftsüéÅor clues provided. 
The event serves not only as a celebration üéâüéäof the holiday season but also as an opportunity for team members to connect on a personal level, sharing laughter and joy even in a virtual setting. 
### 5. Pancakev/s Waffle
![Software for Team Management](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/04/05/kroolo-2.jpg)
  * **Type of game:** Breakfast battle fun /Icebreaker
  * **Time required:** Approximately 20-30 minutes


In your virtual game, you can have a Pancakes vs. Waffles showdown. There are two teams for each - Team Pancakes and Team Waffles.
Team Pancakesü•û says pancakes are the classic and comfy breakfast. You can put all kinds of yummy things on them, like syrup, fruits, or chocolate chips üçá.
Team Wafflesüßá argues that waffles have these perfect little pockets that hold toppings, making every bite awesome.
Share funny stories about your favorite pancakes or waffles. Some team members even made virtual backgrounds with huge stacks of their chosen breakfast ü•£.
It's a fun contest of creativity and humorüòÜ. Even though you don't pick a winnerüèÜ, everyone is happy and feels more connected as a team, even if we're far apart.
### **6. Virtual coffee breaks**
  * **Type of game:** Informal networking/Casual interaction
  * **Time required:** 15-30 minutes


Organizing virtual coffee breaks‚òï for remote teams is a simple and effective way to foster a sense of camaraderie and maintain social connections. 
Team members can schedule short, informal video calls during designated "coffee break" times‚åõ. During these sessions, participants can discuss non-work-related topics, share personal updates, or simply enjoy a casual chat over a cup of coffee or teaü´ñ. 
This virtual coffee break helps recreate the spontaneous interactions that occur in a physical office settingüè®, promoting team bondingüëØ and a more relaxed work atmosphere. 
Team members can also use this time to share interesting articles, and book recommendationsüìö, or even play quick online games to add an element of fun to the break.
### **7. Word association threads**
  * **Type of game:** Asynchronous
  * **Time required:** Ongoing, with participants contributing as they have time


In the word association game, participants start a threadüßµby posting a word. The next participant responds with the first word that comes to mind based on the previous word. 
The chain continues as team members add words, creating a unique and evolving thread. With Kroolo, you can enhance this game by creating dedicated channels for different threads, ensuring that all conversations are managed centrally. 
Kroolo allows for flexible interaction within threads ‚Äî participants can reply, forward‚è©, react, mention, and even attach files seamlessly. 
Enjoy [perfect collaboration within teams](https://kroolo.com/blog/teamwork-triumphs-taking-a-closer-look-at-the-benefits-of-workplace-collaboration)ü´Ç as the word association game unfolds, providing a creative and engaging way for team members to connect and [share ideas](https://kroolo.com/blog/10-group-decision-making-techniques-to-try-with-team-productivity-software) within the organized and user-friendly interface.
### **8. Remote team olympics**

Organize a remote team olympics for a day of fun challenges and collaborationüîî. 
With Kroolo, you can create channels, invite members, and engage in discussions across Teams, making coordination seamless. Incorporate activities like virtual escape roomsüè™, trivia contests, and creative challengesüí™. 
Use Kroolo's features to facilitate smooth communication during the event. Encourage creativityüìùand teamwork, making it an enjoyable dayüòÉthat enhances camaraderie among remote team members.
### **9. Netflix viewing party**
![Software for Team Management](https://hive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Netflix-Party-600x400.jpg)
  * **Type of game:** Virtual movie night
  * **Time required:** 2-3 hours


Organize a Netflix viewing partyüçøfor your remote and in-house teams. Begin by creating a dedicated channel on Kroolo, inviting team members to join. Pick aüé¨movie or series that suits everyone's taste, and use Kroolo‚Äôs chats and channels for detailed discussion.
During the session, team members can engage in real-time discussions, share reactions, and thoughts, and even predict plot twists.üé¶
This laid-back yet immersive event not only offers a delightful break but also fosters a sense of unity and camaraderie among your remote team, making movie night a memorable shared experienceüéûÔ∏è.

### 10. Escape the room
  * **Type of game:** Virtual team-building 
  * **Time required:** 1-2 hours


Imagine playing a game like "Escape the room" with your remote team. You all gather on a video call and join a special website where the game happensüé≠. 
The host tells you a story, like finding a lost treasure. Then, you work together to solve puzzlesüß© and find clues to move forward in the game. For example, you might solve a puzzle to unlock a door or find a hidden keyüóùÔ∏è.
You'll need to talküó£Ô∏è a lot and share ideas to solve everything before the time runs out. When you finish, you'll feel proud of your teamwork and happy to solve the mystery together. 
It's like going on an adventure with your friends, even though you're all playing from homeüè°.
