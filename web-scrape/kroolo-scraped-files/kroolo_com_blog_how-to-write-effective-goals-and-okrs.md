Do you think setting goals is easy?
All you do is jot down items that you’d want to achieve and there you go; your goals!
Well, not quite. It’s very normal as one does not always achieve the goals one sets, and one does not always convert their big dreams into reality.
Goal setting is quite tricky, which is why the idea of OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) exists. But, what are the OKRs, and how to write OKRs to craft effective working goals?
OKRs are a magical goal-setting framework that helps businesses set high goals and execute strategies more effectively. To your surprise, [83% of the surveyed](https://marketsplash.com/okr-statistics/) companies agree that OKRs have a positive impact on their organization. 
[80% of companies](https://marketsplash.com/okr-statistics/) have OKR coaches (or OKR masters or a similar role) to oversee and manage the OKR process. Companies like Google, Netflix, and Twitter often use [Goal Management methodologies](https://kroolo.com/goals) like OKRs to create alignment and measure goals & objectives in your organization.
Here, we will explore the usual challenges people face when they intend to pursue big goals and provide useful guidance on how to form effective objectives and key results.
So, if you want to step up your game to make your dreams come true, keep a close eye.
## Are OKRs and KPIs different?
OKRs and KPIs are two different performance measurement frameworks that enable tracking and achievement of goals.
![performance measurement frameworks - kroolo](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2023/11/10/goal-sideanel.png)
**OKRs**
OKRs focus on setting clear and ambitious objectives and the key results to track success. Objectives are qualitative statements describing what you want to obtain, while key results are measurements for the objectives which are specific, timely, and quantitative data.
In most cases, OKRs act as guides, inspire teamwork, and align the organizational processes. Typically, OKR is a crucial tool for enhancing focus, agility, and constant progress.
**KPIs**
However, KPIs are measurable, defined measurements that are used to judge an organization’s, department’s, or person’s performance. In comparison to this, KPIs are used to monitor operations that are ongoing, as well as to ensure that an organization is achieving its strategic and operational targets.
KPIs are also different from OKRs which are usually rigid and may not change that often. Such tools are used for evaluating many aspects of a business such as financial performance, customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and employee productivity among others.
**Summing up with OKRs V/S KPIs**
As we sum up, OKRs mainly serve to set ambitious objectives and measurable key results for focusing, motivating, and aligning the teams towards continual improvements. Unlike KPIs which encompass specific metrics that track current performance towards the goals of organisation strategies or operations. A combination of OKRs and KPIs is usually used by companies in performance management.
## How To Write Good OKRs and Goals For Your Business? 
### 1. Start with a clear objective
The initial part of writing OKRs is to specify a clear objective. Objectives should be motivating, clearly stated and linked to your organization’s vision and strategy. The question “What do we want?” should be answered. 
Use this template to write your OKRs - I will _[objective]_ as measured by _[key result]._
### 2. Ensure measurability
Identify Key Results that are specific and realistic for every objective. Such measurable results show whether the objectives are attainable or not. You can use the SMART Goal Setting Framework to ensure the measurability of your objective. You can create a Goal in Kroolo, set your priorities for multiple projects, and track the progress of each task.
### 3. Set ambitious targets
OKRs are supposed to extend and test your organization or team. The best way to approach this is to set ambitious yet achievable goals. Make them neither too hard nor too simple, for the best OKRs inspire growth, innovation, and improvement.
### 4. Align with organizational goals
Make sure that your OKRs are in line with the bigger organizational objectives and approach. This alignment ensures everyone sees how their work contributes to the company’s success as a whole. According to [OKR Impact Report 2022](https://mooncamp.com/2022-okr-impact-report/), More than 60% of companies conduct OKR check-ins at least bi-weekly to ensure their organizational goals are in alignment with their approach.
### 5. Keep OKRs transparent
According to [Haufe Talent](https://www.haufe.de/personal/hr-management/studie-erfolgsbilanz-von-okr-in-der-praxis_80_564574.html), 78% of employees who use OKRs are satisfied with their jobs. So, disclose your OKRs to your team, department, or company and train them to use them as this makes collaboration successful. Such a framework helps team leaders and project managers give constructive feedback and owing to that team takes responsibility for their own actions, decisions, and results.
### 6. Regularly review and update
OKRs are not static. In fact, they require discipline and commitment from management and should be reviewed on a regular basis, like every quarter. With inconsistent use of OKRs (1 to 3 cycles per year), the [performance can increase to 3%](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/sears-holding-company-study-shows-okrs-impact-bottom-line-ben-lamorte/). Importantly, don’t forget to celebrate successes and reset your goals based on the outcomes received.
Finally, the creation of successful OKRs entails motivation, quantifiable, target goals that are concurrent to enterprise objectives coupled with giving the teams an enabling environment to embrace responsibility and ownership.
However, they should be simple, clear, and aimed at stimulating expansion, innovativeness, and continuous improvement. It is important to conduct regular reviews and make OKRs adaptable to ensure their relevance and effectiveness in creating success. Done well, however, OKRs can be a very effective way of helping organizations realize strategic objectives and improve overall performance.
## 5 Examples of OKRs
