Have you ever found yourself staring at the technical instructions, trying to decipher obscure jargon?👀
![Staring at document](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/01/02/giphy-staring-document.gif)
O.K., that's where technical documentation comes to the rescue like a superhero and sorts out the mess.
In that case, it is all about condensing complex information📜 into a manual easily adopted by users, making it easy for your clients to make full use of your product.
Well, [according to Fortune Business Insights](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/05/04/2661175/0/en/Document-Management-System-Market-Size-to-Surpass-USD-18-97-billion-by-2030-exhibiting-a-CAGR-of-17-2.html), the demand for document management software will boom to a colossal $18.97 billion by 2030 from $6.23 billion in 2023📈. This surge is more than just an indirect testimony to the growing importance of technical documentation.
## **What is Technical Documentation?**
Technical documentation is a collection of written materials with detailed specifications, functions, and technology, product, system, or process. The main objective is to help clients and users making them learn how to use, maintain, or understand the technology as a reference guide.📑 This documentation typically includes:
**1. User guides or manuals:** Instructions for end-users on how to use the technology or product
**2. Technical specifications:** Technical information, such as system requirements, hardware specifications, and software configurations
**3. API documentation:** Information about app programming interfaces like endpoints, methods, parameters, & responses for developers incorporating the technology into their systems
**4. Installation & configuration guides:** Installation, setup, and configuration instructions for the technology
**5. Troubleshooting and support documents:** Information to enable users to diagnose and resolve frequently encountered problems or errors
**6. Design documents:** A comprehensive description of the system architecture, design decisions, and reasons behind choices in technology
## **Reasons to Write Technical Documentation**
Understanding, using, and maintaining technology all depend on technical documentation. Its detailed and concise instructions, troubleshooting tips, and information about systems, APIs, or products make it easy to use. This documentation guarantees consistency, reduces error, assists training, and encourages cooperation among all involved parties. User experience is improved while the level of support needed is reduced. And at the same time, it offers -:
  * Clear instructions and guidance
  * Error reduction and consistency
  * Support for training and onboarding
  * Enhanced collaboration among stakeholders
  * Better user experience, less maintenance needed


## **Types of Technical Documentation**
There are 2 main types of technical documentation.
### **1. Product Documentation**
Product documentation describes the features, functions, and usage specifications of a particular technology or system. Its materials include a broad range, from assisting developers to end-users.
This manual includes a **user experience (UX) guide** , which explains how to navigate through the software; repair manuals providing instructions for fixing product problems; and system-specific documents designed for developers and manufacturers of products.
Its main function is to teach users how properly to utilize the product, and at the same time, it also helps developers understand and improve on underpinning technology.
  * **Focus** : Functionalities, detailed features, and usage instructions
  * **Examples** : UX guides, repair manuals, and system-specific documents
  * **Types** : UX design, product requirements, API guidelines, source code explanations, updates, and user guides; Technical architecture and manuals
  * **Audience** : Developers, manufacturers, and end-users
  * **Purpose** : Makes effective use of products for users, and makes it easier for developers to understand the technology and to improve it


### ![Comparison](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/01/10/internal-image-1_BuEFrhK.png)
### 2. Process documentation
In contrast, process documentation takes a look at the basic mechanisms and techniques behind the production of products. These documents are mainly directed at developers and designers and provide a glimpse of what goes on behind the scenes in development.
Such materials include project plans detailing outlines and schedules; detailed testing strategies describing how the product is to be evaluated; and internal troubleshooting aids helping in problem-solving during stages of development. Documentation for the process includes various items, such as test schedules to ensure thorough product evaluation, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) describing development workflows, papers providing information and analysis, case studies, and product roadmaps.
The major goal is to make development processes clear and generate integrated roadmaps for the development team in order to understand this creation process.
  * **Focus** : How products are made: Inner workings and procedures
  * **Examples** : Project plans, testing strategies, and troubleshooting guides
  * **Types** : Test programs, development SOPs, white papers, case studies, and product roadmaps
  * **Audience** : Product creation: Developers and designers
  * **Purpose** : It clarifies development processes, sets roadmaps, and provides insights into the creation process for the development team
