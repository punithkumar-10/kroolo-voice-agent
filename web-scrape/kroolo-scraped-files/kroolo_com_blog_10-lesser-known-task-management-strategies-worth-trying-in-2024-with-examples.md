## **What are Task Management Strategies?**
Task management strategy follows structured methods for organizing, and prioritizing, and getting tasks done. It involves planning, organizing, taking action, and optimizing one's work to reach the goals efficiently. 
According to [FinancesOnline](https://financesonline.com/project-management-software-statistics/), 95% of people feel that having a list of tasks to do every day is good for their mental health. Typically, when you meticulously follow your plans and implement tasks as per the planning, it calms your mind and [recharges your mental well-being](https://kroolo.com/blog/how-to-stay-organized-and-stress-free-with-these-12-task-management-strategies)üíÜ.

## **Lesser Known 10 Task Management Strategies to Implement in 2024**
### **1. OHIO principle**
The OHIO _(Only Handle It Once)_ principle is a model for productivity. It promotes a **'touch it once'** attitude toward tasks: once you start something, go all the way. This principle is especially useful for simple work such as emails or telephone calls. It encourages a quick response and prevents tasks from piling up and cluttering the mind.
OHIO solves the problem of short tasks that are often ignored or postponed. These tasks don't just linger in your inbox or on a to-do list, they get swift attention.
![Schedule image](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/01/10/internal-image-1.png)
But this approach is not always practical right away. So, if you can‚Äôt take immediate action, then set a reminder for future attentionüóì.
**Example** : Imagine getting an email asking you to comment on a proposalüì©. Rather than simply flagging it as unread and returning to it several times before giving a response, apply the OHIO principle. Read it thoroughly and submit feedback immediately. This keeps tasks from generating mental clutter.
### **2. Task batching with context-switching awareness**
The batching of tasks with context-switching awareness is that you take tasks similar in nature and do them together.
![3 process](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/01/10/internal-image-2.png)
Suppose you have emails, reports, and calls to deal with. Rather than continually hopping back and forth, you collect all of the emails that need to be answered in one go.
Then turn your attention to reports followed by calls. This allows your brain to stay on the same thing without having to change gears all the time.
It's like you were giving your brain a better road to work on, making everything easier and more orderly. By doing this, you're not forcing your brain to switch tasks suddenly. You keep your work flowing smoothly.
**Example** : Set aside dedicated time for writing reportsüìÉ, another for emailsüìß, and again one for phone callsüìû. This reduces the cognitive burden of continually switching contexts.
### **3. Time capsuling**
The time capsuling method is composed of brief spurts of intensive concentration at a single task within a prescribed period.
You select a short, powerful burst of time--say 15-30 minutes--and focus all your concentration on one task. It‚Äôs all about hyper-focus! No distractions are allowed.
This technique takes advantage of your peak concentration, getting a lot done in that short time. Here, you get your work done and don't burn out.
**Example** : Spend 20 minutes with a timer‚è≥. All you think about is how to outline the plan for a project. During this encapsulated period, avoid all diversions or interruptions. The method helps you concentrate on your tasks and thus improve your productivity in a short time.
### **4. Reverse planning**
Ever thought about planning backward?‚óÄ That's what reverse planning or backward design is all about! 
![Routine](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/01/10/internal-image-3.png)
So rather than beginning from zero, build your plan upwards towards your objectives.
Visualize what you ultimately hope to accomplish, and divide things into steps. It's like walking backward, meaning that every step is taken with the ultimate destination in mind.
This approach makes things clear so that every task is a step closer to your goal.üéØ
**Example:** If you have a product launch coming up in half a year. First, imagine the launch day. Then map out milestones and tasks on the way to your goal. It is an organized approach, with each step leading smoothly to the next and thence on to the final objective**.**
### 5. Utilizing wait-time tasks
Using "wait-time" means identifying and taking action on small, doable tasks while waiting or downtime is minimal.
Do you know those times when people are waiting for something? Waiting to start a meeting, get on the bus, or stand in line.
Wait-Time Tasks liven up those idle moments. These are the easy wins, the tasks you can blow off a bit. Use these times to zap off a few short emails, jot down some ideas, or sort through things on your to-do list instead of mindlessly scrolling through social media. It's a trick turning waiting time into working time.
So the next time you're waiting around, send productivity a smile and wave goodbye üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èto minutes of wasted time.
**Example** : Found time while waiting for a meeting to start to reply quickly to short emails, jot down ideas for an upcoming presentation, or review meeting agendas. This gets the most out of otherwise idle moments.
### **6. Two envelope technique**
The Two-Envelope Technique üì®asks you to create two metaphorical envelopes for every task, one for things under your control and the other for things not under your control.
It's about doing what you can and planning for what depends on others or external factors. Split them up like this, and prepare for dependencies while focusing on actionable steps.
This method concentrates on what you can affect and gives insight into how to do a task so that you can be ready for both action-man scenarios as well as waiting-game situations.
**Example** : Think, for example, of the time you were working on a project with a hard deadline and waiting for information from another team. In the ‚Äúwithin my control" envelope write out steps such as research, preliminary drafts, and preparing resources. Waiting for the team's input task is in the "beyond my control" envelope. It allows us to focus on concrete steps without forgetting dependencies.
### 7. Minimum effective dose
The ‚ÄúMinimum Effective Dose‚Äù approach is like the fine art of cooking, with only enough ingredients to make it palatable without extras. It's all about doing what it takes to win, without going overboard.
By focusing on and zeroing in on the essentials, this method gets more done with less effort and waste of time on meaningless work. Doing only what needs to be done, but nothing more: It is like a shortcut to success.
**Example** : Suppose you're preparing a presentation. However, cut out the extraneous information. Focus on the key points that must be delivered clearly and powerfully. Do not put too much emphasis on details, but get to the point, as long as what is delivered meets the needs of the audience.
### **8. Bookend technique**
In the Bookend technique, you begin and end your workday by going over tasks. You set intentions and plan the day in the morningüåÑ.
**Example** : Take a few minutes at the beginning of each day to look over your task list. Before planning your schedule, work out the order of importance. At the end of each day, think back on what was done, make a fresh to-do list for tomorrow, and allow your brain to shift out of work gears.
### **9. Two-minute miracle technique**
The "Two-Minute Miracle" is your little secret weapon of productivity. It's simple: Allot only two minutes a day to the start of major undertakings. Whether planning out a report or scribbling down ideas, these little two-minute bursts put things in motion.
It's like opening the door to the land of production, once you get started it is easier to go on. This method beats procrastination and establishes consistency. Two minutes isn't long, but it's a mighty one when it comes to getting things started!
![Confused man](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/01/10/internal-image-4.png)
**Example** : If you're preparing a report, for example, spend just two minutes writing the opening paragraph or outlining your sections. Beginning work on the task, even just for a bit, creates inertia that keeps one moving after it stops.
### **10. Task transition rituals**
Ah, Task transition rituals are like reset buttonsüîÑ for the mind between tasks. They're short, deliberate actions that enable you to change gears more smoothly.
Just imagine taking a short walk or having some reflections after finishing up one task, and then diving right into the next.
These rituals serve as mental reboots, clearing your head and preparing you for what is to come. They guarantee that you are truly here, avoiding the mental detritus of one task from getting into another.
**Example** : Finish a focused work session with a few minutes walk, record some notes on what you have just done, or practice breathing deeply for several minutes. These rituals mark a mental transition, preparing you to take on the next task with new resolve.
------
These strategies offer subtly different ways to manage pieces of work, advising you to make the best use of your time in each possible type of situation.
