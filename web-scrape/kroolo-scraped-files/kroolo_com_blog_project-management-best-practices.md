Every project starts with an idea. And it takes some time to put the idea board into an active campaign. However, there’s no denying that managing & implementing the project plan is equally challenging and requires utmost precision. 
At every stage of your project plan, you need to ensure that each process is aiding you to complete the task on time, within budget, and meet all the desired parameters. 
The dedicated project managers might have mastered the art of balancing the stakeholder engagement and their scope of work to mitigate potential risk & [overcome scope creep](https://kroolo.com/blog/scope-creep-in-project-management-meaning-causes-and-strategies-to-overcome-2). 
But, when you’re working on a big-size project, you cannot pull out all the nitty gritties of that project. So, in that case, having the best practices in hand can help you collect every little detail of the project.
In this blog, we’ve listed 12 [project management best practices](https://kroolo.com/features/projects) to streamline your workflows with modern tools. 
## **What Do You Mean by Project Management Best Practices?**
Project Management Best Practices refer to a set of guidelines, principles, and techniques that have been established over time to ensure successful project delivery. These practices are derived from the experiences of successful projects and are designed to improve project efficiency, effectiveness, and outcomes.
## **12 Project Management Best Practices To Implement**
![12 project management best practices](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/05/29/kroolo.jpg)
Here are some of the [project management](https://kroolo.com/blog/proven-saas-project-management-techniques) best practices that you must follow while implementing your business case for your project -: 
### **1. Clear project objectives**
Define clear, measurable [project goals & objectives](https://kroolo.com/blog/goals-vs-objectives-navigating-the-difference-from-a-project-managers-perspective) from the outset. Ensure that all stakeholders understand and agree on these objectives.
For a new product launch, the project manager sets specific objectives such as "Increase market share by 5% within six months" and "Achieve a customer satisfaction rating of 90% for the new product." 
These objectives are communicated to all team members and stakeholders, ensuring everyone is working towards the same goals.
### **2. Effective communication**
Establish regular communication channels among team members, stakeholders, and leadership. Use tools like [project management software](https://kroolo.com/blog/project-management-software), emails, and meetings to keep everyone informed and aligned. 
According to a [study by PMI](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/communication-11189), projects with effective communication are 80% more likely to finish on time and within budget.
### **3. Comprehensive planning**
Develop a detailed project plan outlining tasks, timelines, resources, and dependencies. 
Consider using techniques like [Work Breakdown Structure](https://kroolo.com/blog/project-management-technique) (WBS) and Gantt charts to visualize and manage project activities.
### **4. Risk management**
Identify potential risks early in the project lifecycle and develop strategies to mitigate them. Regularly assess and update the risk register throughout the project.
For instance, in a software development project, the team identifies a potential risk of scope creep due to ambiguous requirements. 
To mitigate this risk, the project manager conducts thorough requirements gathering sessions with stakeholders and implements a change control process to manage scope changes effectively.
### **5. Resource allocation**
Allocate resources efficiently based on skillsets, availability, and project requirements. Ensure that team members have the necessary tools and support to fulfill their roles effectively.
### **6. Stakeholder engagement**
Involve key stakeholders throughout the project to gather feedback, address concerns, and manage expectations. Keep stakeholders informed about project progress and any changes.
### **7. Agile approach**
For complex or evolving projects, consider adopting agile methodologies such as [Scrum](https://kroolo.com/blog/scrum-management-empowering-gig-workers-in-the-project-hustle-2) or [Kanban](https://kroolo.com/blog/12-essential-kanban-board-examples-for-2024). Agile promotes flexibility, [team collaboration](https://kroolo.com/blog/effective-team-collaboration), and iterative development. 
And, if you want to bring agility within your teammates to speed up the work, conduct sessions for [agile games](https://kroolo.com/blog/11-agile-games-to-boost-performance-with-team-productivity-software) in your organization. This brings synergy within team to work for a common objective. 
[![project management best practices](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/05/17/13.png)](https://app.kroolo.com/signup?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=CTA&utm_content=project-management-best-practices)
### **8. Quality assurance**
Implement processes to monitor and maintain quality standards throughout the project lifecycle. Conduct regular reviews, testing, and quality checks to identify and address issues promptly.
For instance, in a construction project, the quality assurance team conducts regular site inspections and tests materials to ensure compliance with building codes and standards.
Any deviations or defects are promptly addressed to maintain quality and prevent rework.
### **9. Change management**
Anticipate and manage changes effectively to minimize disruptions and maintain project momentum. Establish clear change control procedures and communicate changes transparently to all stakeholders.
### **10. Performance tracking & reporting**
[Track project performance](https://kroolo.com/blog/project-management-team-metrics-key-indicators-to-track-success-in-2024) against key metrics such as budget, schedule, and scope. Generate regular progress reports to provide visibility into project status and performance.
In a marketing campaign project, the project manager uses a project management tool to track key performance indicators such as budget spent, tasks completed, and campaign reach. 
Weekly status reports are generated and shared with the marketing team and executive sponsors to keep everyone informed about the project’s progress and any adjustments needed to stay on track.
### **11. Continuous improvement**
Encourage a culture of continuous improvement within the project team. Regularly reflect on lessons learned, identify areas for enhancement, and implement process improvements.
So, for instance, after completing a marketing campaign project, the project team holds a retrospective meeting to review what went well and what could be improved. 
They identify bottlenecks in the approval process and implement a streamlined workflow for future campaigns, leading to increased efficiency and faster delivery times.
### **12. Closure and evaluation**
Upon project completion, conduct a thorough post-project review to evaluate successes, challenges, and lessons learned. Document insights and recommendations for future projects.
By implementing project management best practices, project managers can enhance the likelihood of project success and deliver value to stakeholders.
