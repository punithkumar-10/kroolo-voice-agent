# Security
Safeguarding and security of your information is our utmost priority.
## **Protecting Customer Data**
Kroolo is responsible for implementing and managing the right security controls for our customers. The focus of Kroolo’s security policy is to prevent unauthorized access, use, and disclosure of customer data. 
## **Security Compliance**
Kroolo is continuously monitoring and improving upon the design and effectiveness of our security controls. We partner with a reputable third party for their independent assessment of our efforts. All internal and external audit findings are shared with executive management. 
## **Penetration Testing**
Kroolo engages an independent third party to conduct annual network and application penetration tests. Identified findings are tracked to resolution, and results reports are shared with executive management.
## **Our Responsibility**
### **Access Control**
When provisioning access, IT adheres to the principles of least privilege and role-based access control, meaning that employees are only authorized the access and permissions required to fulfill their job responsibilities. User access reviews, including production access, are performed semi-annually. Access to the production infrastructure and supporting systems requires MFA. 
Employee access is revoked within two business days of an employee’s termination. In the event of involuntary termination, access is revoked immediately.
### **Cloud Hosting**
Kroolo uses AWS as its cloud hosting provider - all data is stored in region US-East-1. Kroolo utilizes serverless instances across AWS to ensure high availability of all services. 
### **Data Retention**
Kroolo retains data for the duration of the customer’s use of the application. Customer data is removed upon request for user account deletion or upon customer contract termination. Kroolo’s hosting provider, AWS, is responsible for ensuring proper sanitization of disks and physical media.
### **Encryption**
Kroolo encrypts all customer data at rest and in transit using strong encryption methods. All information is transmitted via HTTPS using TLS1.2+ with AES256 encryption and SHA2 signatures, defaulting to TLS1.3 based on client ability. Data at rest is encrypted at the storage level using AES256. Database connections are verified using TLS certificates, and encrypted in transit using SSL. 
Encryption keys are managed by and stored securely in AWS. Access to encryption keys is restricted to limited, authorized personnel and requires MFA. All key usage is logged and monitored for anomalous activity. 
### **Endpoints**
Employees are provisioned company-managed workstations. All workstations are configured with disk encryption, anti-malware, and idle lockout. IT monitors employee workstations to ensure they are compliant with corporate policy and up-to-date with relevant patches. 
### **Logging**
Centralized logging is enabled for all production systems. These logs are reviewed for indications of compromise and alerted upon. The Security team is responsible for monitoring and alerting thresholds are reached, tracking security events to resolution in accordance with the incident response plan.
**Network**
Kroolo’s firewalls are configured to deny all incoming traffic by default. Firewall rules are reviewed at least annually. Kroolo also utilizes a WAF and CDN in order to both protect against common web application vulnerabilities, like DDoS attacks, and to provide faster access to the application. 
### **Personnel**
Security of the Kroolo environment is the responsibility of all Kroolo employees, contractors, and temporary workers who have access to Kroolo’s information systems. Prior to their start date, all employees must have a completed background check on file, in addition to signing confidentiality agreements. 
All employees are required to complete security awareness training upon hire and annually thereafter. Training curriculum includes phishing awareness, remote work best practices, device security, and incident reporting. In addition to completing training, employees are required to review the employee handbook and code of conduct policy. Violations of any corporate policies may result in disciplinary measures up to and including termination. 
### **Secure Development**
Kroolo has built a secure software development lifecycle (SDLC), including requirements like peer code review. All code is managed in a version control repository, with branch protections in place. Access to source code requires MFA. 
Non-standard code changes go through a change management process that covers emergency changes and hotfixes. The agile nature of the process allows for engineers to follow their own release cycles, deploying continuous improvements to the Kroolo platform. 
### **Vulnerability Management**
Vulnerability scans are performed daily for in-scope systems. Identified vulnerabilities are remediated in accordance with severity. 
## **Your Responsibility**
Though Kroolo is responsible for most security controls, our customers are responsible for securing their user accounts. This includes creating strong passwords if using Google for authentication, provisioning user accounts and permissions, and disabling accounts as needed. 
Additionally, customers are responsible for determining the appropriateness of the data entered into the application. By default, Kroolo handles limited customer PII (name and email). The sensitivity of the data that customers input to generate content is ultimately their responsibility. Customers should be aware that Kroolo is not PCI or HIPAA compliant and should refrain from providing cardholder information and protected health information.
