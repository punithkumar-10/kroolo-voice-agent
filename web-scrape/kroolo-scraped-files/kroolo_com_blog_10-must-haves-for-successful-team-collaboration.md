  * Establish specific individual and work objectives


### 2. Great communication and dialogue
The process of working with others starts with communication. Surprisingly, about [one-third of the projects crumble because of ineffective communication](https://www.tameday.com/improve-project-communication/). People’s communication skills with each other, within the team, and also with the others outside the team determine the success of a team.
In the long run, a team with opinions that are appreciated and heard will always create a better working outcome. In the case whereby the ideas will be considered and acted upon, each team member will possess a direct attachment to their team. And that brings synergy within the team to deliver any complex and challenging project. 
### 3. Conflict management
There are always disagreements among people within a group including at their workplaces. In this case, somewhere one has to make healthy comprise to test the response. As a team leader or project manager, help your colleagues perform at their optimum levels. Ensure that they do not feel as though their good ideas are being discarded just to make way for another. 
Working together and putting behind your differences for the sake of good teamwork and achieving genuine results is what promotes successful team collaboration, right? However, it's not easy to negotiate and sometimes even after you have done your best conflict will come. 
But, as a leader, you must transparently solve problems and ensure team members understand their course to achieve the goal. 
### 4. Reliability
The best practices for promoting seamless collaboration include transparency and reliability which create trust. In its absence, you only have a team and not people collaborating for sure. This is an integral team play. People here have to understand that they are expected to pull their weight. A team thrives because of what everyone brings into it. This applies particularly to teams with remote members.
### 5. Diversity
Diversity does not only involve the different skill sets and specialized expertise required for the roles to deliver the project but also the characters of people in the roles. 
Working in a team is beautiful because it helps individuals to relate based on different perceptions and experiences.

### 6. The right leaders
For a team to be successful, it must have skillful & torch-bearing leaders. Assuming such a responsibility is never an easy task as it requires both technical and personal skills, which together should be infused with the organization’s skills. 
As a project manager, you should have some harmony that will not just drive to team to realize objectives within the set timeframe and criteria but also include different individuals in the team to create a collaborative environment.
### 7. Invite co-creation
Team collaboration is based on the assumption that teams can achieve more than any individual member alone. Therefore, co-creation is one of the best promotion techniques for team cooperation. 
Do not instruct team members to work as a group; conduct brainstorming sessions, invite discussion, and allow disagreement. Co-creation does not mean splitting a goal into small parts and working independently.
However, co-creation does not require face-to-face meetings. An asynchronous brainstorming session would be highly beneficial. One of the easiest ways to co-create in a virtual team is by working in a Google Doc; they will just open it up and add to each other’s ideologies.
### 8. Encourage open conversation
Collaboration takes place whilst team contributors experience they can bring their entire selves to work. Team participants need to be endorsed to participate, innovate, and talk. Instead of protecting their thoughts or reigning their feelings, they can be themselves and produce all of the exceptional ideas that come with it.
But open verbal exchange is additionally a way that, from time to time, people are going to disagree. Disagreements are not counter to group collaboration. In truth, healthful disagreements and open conversations are essential to unlocking a hit group collaboration.
### 9. Highlight successful teamwork
Everyone loves to be identified for completing a task efficiently—and congratulating crew members on successful teamwork isn't any one of a kind. They work together to deliver a new idea to fruition or lead a difficult initiative. So, take time to offer them kudos.
Ask team individuals to share their impressions approximately their experience—what worked well? How did they collaborate and paint together to obtain their goal? 
This no longer offers them a properly deserved second within the spotlight, but it can also function as a blueprint for other group contributors to collaborate in the future.
### 10. Offer mentorship opportunities
Building team collaboration is a gentle skill. It's a mixture of interpersonal and verbal exchange competencies. Every team member can leverage such opportunities to enhance one's abilities. 
So, embrace mentorship for improved teamwork. Build meaningful links for elevating skills and knowledge. Create a space for veterans to mentor and motivate others; promote a learning organization. A united effort to create a more efficient team that promotes innovation and ultimately leads to success.
