35% of projects failed, according to a recent PMI study.
Reason? Due to the low level of technological maturity.
**Imagine** - What if your projects and processes are trained with the latest technologies ü§ñto improve the outcome of your projects? Well, this leads to on-time project submission, synchronization with managers, fewer budget overagesüí∞, and synergy within the team.
![ai and automation in project management](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2024/02/06/6bye.gif)
Yes, you‚Äôve certainly guessed it right. We‚Äôre talking about [AI project management software](https://kroolo.com/projects). 
According to KPMG‚Äôs Trust in Artificial Intelligence: Global Insights 2023 report, 42% of individuals fear AI will replace jobs in their area of work. 
[Gartner predicts](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-03-20-gartner-says-80-percent-of-today-s-project-management) that by 2030, 80% of project management tasks will be run by AI. Businesses are counting on it to boost project performanceüìà. Therefore it‚Äôs time to invest in smart AI-based project Management Software to transform your project management process at the workplace.

## **Is Artificial Intelligence Going to Replace Project Managers?**
The application of modern technology in [AI project management tools](https://kroolo.com/blog/get-zillion-tasks-done-how-kroolo-can-save-your-time-maximize-your-roi) has been greatly improved but there are no facts to prove that it can replace project managersüë®‚Äçüíª. However, it complements abilities rather than replaces them thereby enabling them to work on tasks involving human intelligence. 
However, project managers have emotion, planning strategy, and flexibility that AI cannot have. These include project managers who will interpret the AI-generated data, make critical decisions for the sake of the organization, encourage teamwork in diverse circumstances, and navigate complicated situations where human expertise is needed.
  * **Augmentation, not replacement -** While project managers work with AI, it frees up the project manager‚Äôs time ‚è≥so that he or she can work on long-term and other strategic decisions.
  * **Human judgment and creativity -** Emotional intelligence, critical thinkingü§î, & adaptability are something project managers have that AI does not and this helps them deal with complex and intricate circumstances.
  * **Interpreting AI insights -** Although AI provides much significant information, it is the project managers who interpret and apply these findings for practical solutions.
  * **Stakeholder engagement -** Human interactions are important in building relationshipsüë´, managing expectations, and effective communication with stakeholders which AI can never achieve.
  * **Adaptability and flexibility -** AI can‚Äôt adapt to changing situations as fast as a project manager.
  * **Ethical and moral decision-making -** In some instances, AI cannot evaluate morals and ethics, and as such it‚Äôs essential to consider human value principles.


Put simply, AI is a potent instrument that improves efficiency and offers reliable data-driven guidance. However, the indispensable aspect of the human element remains in place. 
## **Understanding** AI and Automation in Project Management
Long before the digital era, companies were promoting repetitive manual tasks, and the concept of ‚Äòproductivity‚Äô was kept at bay. This has greatly hindered business agility and brought innovativeness to a toss. 
However, today, due to the upsurge of [AI and automation in project management](https://kroolo.com/blog/how-ai-based-project-management-software-transform-workflows), companies can track the no of hours spent ‚è≤on particular projects, eliminate repetitive tasks, and promote smart and intelligent processes at the workplace to enhance overall business productivity.
Approximately 60% of organizations now use workflow automation tools for analytics and business process automation.
_‚ÄúWhich tasks need to be assigned today_ üìö _?‚Äù_
_‚ÄúWhat are the top priorities for a particular project?‚Äù_
_‚ÄúWho is the perfect fit for a particular task?‚Äù_
When project managers don‚Äôt have enough information üìÑor relevant data to answer their questions, AI comes into action. It bridges the gaps by offering valuable insights through predictive analytics, advanced decision-making support, mining all past data recordsüì∞, and lastly intelligent reporting.
Thus, investing in [all-in-one project management software](https://kroolo.com/blog/tech-talk-understanding-ai-in-productivity-platforms)with AI capabilities makes your head turn based on its knowledge of conditions, traffic, and past trips.

### **2. Intelligent task prioritization**
Machine learning algorithms are used in AI-based project management software to assign priorities using deadlines, dependencies, resource availability historical data, and other factors. This enables the most important jobs to be handled first, improving workflow throughput and timely completion of project milestones‚è∞.
### **3. Predictive resource allocation**
AI-powered systems forecast resource requirements by analyzing past project data and workload using personnel, time, and materials more efficiently. The predictive strength reduces bottlenecks, does not overwhelm the personnel involved, and improves resource use throughout the project duration.
### **4. Automated workflow optimization**
As they manage their work, workflows are automatically monitored by AI-driven project management tools, pointing out inefficiencies and proposing to improve processes. These systems can automate workflows so that they adapt to dynamic project demands and thus create more efficient processes overall. 
A study from Harvard Business Review states that applying AI and other technological innovations in project management can increase the success ratio by 25%.
### **5. Intelligent risk management**
By using historical project data, current trends, and external factors, AI-equipped software can evaluate and reduce risks. It identifies potential risks and suggests preventive measures that assist teamsüë• in handling challenges in advance hence avoiding disrupting smooth project operation.
### **6. Enhanced communication and collaboration**
Seamless communications among team members are enhanced through AI-based project management platforms that have [real-time collaboration tools](https://kroolo.com/blog/10-must-haves-for-successful-team-collaboration), translate different languages, and provide contextual suggestions for better interactions. This makes the project environment more connected in an improved manner.
### **7. Data-driven decision making**
The systems provide extensive analytical and reporting capabilities through mining their immense project data. These include assessments of project performance, team productivity, and bottlenecks that help to inform the stakeholders appropriately and enable them to drive continuous improvements of projects.
